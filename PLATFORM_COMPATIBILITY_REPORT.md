```

**Mitigation Implemented:**
- Fallback to unrestricted models (microsoft/DialoGPT-small)

**Solutions Implemented:**
- Dynamic path resolution based on platform detection
- Fallback data creation when datasets unavailable
- Platform-specific mount point configuration
- Cache optimization for each environment

## Performance Benchmarks

### TTT Adapter Initialization Times:
- **Kaggle:** 14.26s (with optimizations)
- **Colab:** 14.04s (with optimizations)
- **Local:** ~20s (full configuration)

### Memory Usage Patterns:
```
Platform | Base Memory | Peak Memory | Optimization Level
---------|-------------|-------------|-------------------
Kaggle   | 2-3GB      | 5-6GB       | Moderate
Colab    | 1-2GB      | 3-4GB       | Aggressive
Local    | 3-4GB      | 8-10GB      | Minimal
```
