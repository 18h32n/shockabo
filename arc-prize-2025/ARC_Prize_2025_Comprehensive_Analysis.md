## What is ARC-AGI?

### Background
ARC-AGI (Abstract and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence) was introduced by François Chollet in his influential 2019 paper "On the Measure of Intelligence". It's designed as the only AI benchmark that tests for general intelligence by measuring skill acquisition rather than just skill itself.

### Core Principles
- **Intelligence Definition**: "AGI is a system that can efficiently acquire new skills outside of its training data"
- **Focus on Fluid Intelligence**: Tests reasoning ability rather than accumulated knowledge
- **Core Knowledge Priors**: Uses only universal cognitive primitives available to all humans
- **Easy for Humans, Hard for AI**: Tasks humans solve effortlessly but AI finds challenging

### ARC-AGI-2 Dataset Structure
- **Public Training Set**: 1,000 tasks for algorithm training
- **Public Evaluation Set**: 120 tasks for testing performance  
- **Semi-Private Evaluation Set**: 120 tasks for leaderboard standings
- **Private Evaluation Set**: 120 tasks for final competition ranking

- **Test Input**: Final grid requiring output prediction
- **Format**: JSON arrays of integers representing colored grids
- **Goal**: Pixel-perfect prediction of test output

### Example Task Structure
```json
{
  "train": [
    {"input": [[1, 0], [0, 0]], "output": [[1, 1], [1, 1]]},
    {"input": [[0, 0], [4, 0]], "output": [[4, 4], [4, 4]]},
    {"input": [[0, 0], [6, 0]], "output": [[6, 6], [6, 6]]}
  ],
  "test": [
    {"input": [[0, 0], [0, 8]], "output": "PREDICT_THIS"}
  ]
}
```

## Successful Approaches

### 1. Discrete Program Search
- First approach to achieve meaningful success
- Searches through massive program space systematically
- Good baseline performance but computationally intensive

### 2. Ensemble Solutions
- Combines multiple existing solutions
- Current approach for highest scores
- Limited generalization to unseen tasks

### 3. Direct LLM Prompting
- Traditional LLM prompting performs poorly (<5%)
- Fine-tuned LLMs achieve ~10% accuracy
- Limited by lack of internet access in submissions

### 4. Domain-Specific Language (DSL) Program Synthesis
- Develops specialized language for grid transformations
- Encapsulates common concepts (rotation, mirroring, etc.)
- Synthesizes programs by composing primitives

### 5. Active Inference with LLMs
- Fine-tunes LLMs on task demonstration examples
- Expands limited examples artificially
- Achieved current state-of-the-art (34% by Jack Cole)

### Promising Future Approach (François Chollet's Recommendation)
**Hybrid: Discrete Program Search + Deep Learning Intuition**
- Use deep learning to guide program search
- Leverage LLM intuition to prune search space
- Combines symbolic reasoning with neural guidance
