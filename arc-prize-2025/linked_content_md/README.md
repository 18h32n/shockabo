## Key Insights Summary

### Competition Goals
- **Primary Objective**: Achieve 85% accuracy on ARC-AGI-2 private evaluation
- **Grand Prize**: $700,000 split among top 5 qualifying teams
- **Mission**: Accelerate open AGI research through breakthrough solutions

### Technical Challenge
- **Current AI Best**: 53% accuracy (2024 competition)
- **Human Baseline**: 73.3% - 77.2% average performance  
- **Gap to Close**: 32+ percentage points for grand prize
- **Breakthrough Required**: Novel reasoning capabilities beyond current AI

### Promising Approaches
1. **Hybrid Program Search**: Combine discrete search with neural guidance
2. **Domain-Specific Languages**: Encode reasoning patterns in specialized languages  
3. **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple complementary approaches
