# Critical Assumptions for ARC Prize 2025 Approach

## Core Technical Assumptions
1. **Test-Time Training (TTT) Scaling**: TTT effectiveness can scale from current 55% to 85% with optimization
2. **Strategy Combination**: Multiple strategies (TTT + program synthesis) yield multiplicative gains, not just additive
3. **Dataset Consistency**: Private evaluation set maintains similar difficulty to public set (no adversarial examples)
4. **LoRA Sufficiency**: LoRA adaptation is sufficient for test-time learning (full fine-tuning not required)
5. **DSL Expressiveness**: DSL with ~50 operations can express majority of ARC transformations
6. **Model Size**: 8B parameter models are optimal for accuracy/efficiency trade-off within budget
7. **Data Augmentation**: Current augmentation techniques remain effective on unseen task types

## Constraints We're Accepting
- $0.42 computational cost per task (hard limit)
- Kaggle environment: P100/T4 GPU, 16GB RAM, 5-second inference
- Python-only implementation
- PyTorch as primary framework

## Key Decision
**Building on proven TTT approach rather than pursuing entirely novel architecture**

## When to Revisit
If we plateau below 70% accuracy despite optimizations, these assumptions should be challenged systematically to identify alternative paths.
