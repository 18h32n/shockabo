**Timeline**: Throughout Weeks 1-2

**User Actions (No Development Resources):**
- Platform account creation: Kaggle, Colab, Paperspace verification
- API key generation: W&B, GCS service accounts, secure storage
- Email notification configuration for system alerts
- Platform resource availability testing and quota verification

**Model Usage**: None (User responsibility)
**Cost**: $0 (User time investment only)
