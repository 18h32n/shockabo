# Epic 1 Revised Development Plan - Post Story 1.4 Completion

## Current Status (2025-09-13)

**Completed Stories:**
- âœ… **Story 1.1**: Multi-platform development environment (DONE)
- âœ… **Story 1.2**: ARC data pipeline (DONE with exceptional performance: 260K+ tasks/second)
- âœ… **Story 1.4**: TTT baseline implementation (DONE with 25% accuracy target, all infrastructure validated)

**In Progress/Ready:**
- ðŸ“‹ **Story 1.3**: Evaluation framework (Ready for Review - comprehensive implementation complete)
- ðŸ“‹ **Story 1.5**: Scale to 8B model (Approved with risk mitigation tools complete)

## Recommended Priority Order

### IMMEDIATE NEXT STEP: Complete Story 1.3
**Rationale**: Essential foundation for all future development
- Status: Implementation complete, needs final review/testing
- Effort: 1-2 days to close remaining QA items
- Impact: Unlocks ability to properly measure progress on all future stories
- Dependencies: Required for Story 1.5 validation

### SECOND PRIORITY: Execute Story 1.5 
**Rationale**: Major performance leap needed for competitive baseline
- Status: Approved with comprehensive risk mitigation tools in place
- Target: Scale from 25% (1B model) to 53%+ accuracy (8B model) 
- Effort: 1-2 weeks implementation with validation
- Strategic Value: Establishes competitive baseline for Epic 2-3 development

### ORIGINAL STORY REMOVED: Hexagonal Architecture Core
**Rationale**: Architecture is already well-established through Stories 1.1-1.4
- The codebase already demonstrates excellent architectural patterns
- Domain-driven design, dependency injection, and clean separation implemented
- Additional architectural work would provide diminishing returns
- Focus should shift to performance improvements and strategy development

## Updated Epic 1 Success Criteria

### Foundation Metrics (Stories 1.1-1.3)
- âœ… **Data Pipeline**: 260,112 tasks/second (26,000x target exceeded)
- âœ… **Memory Management**: 0.68GB peak usage (93% under 10GB limit)
- âœ… **Development Environment**: Multi-platform compatibility proven
- ðŸ“‹ **Evaluation Framework**: Pixel-perfect accuracy + W&B integration

### Performance Targets (Stories 1.4-1.5)
- âœ… **1B Baseline**: 25% accuracy achieved with TTT methodology
- ðŸ“‹ **8B Target**: 53%+ accuracy with QLoRA optimization
- ðŸ“‹ **Inference Speed**: Single task under 7.2 minutes
- ðŸ“‹ **Memory Efficiency**: 8B model under 24GB GPU memory

## Strategic Recommendations

### 1. Complete Story 1.3 FIRST (Days 1-2)
**Actions:**
- Finalize QA review items (JWT auth, W&B integration testing)
- Validate pixel-perfect accuracy against competition requirements
- Complete integration testing for real-time dashboard
- Document W&B setup procedures

### 2. Execute Story 1.5 with Confidence (Weeks 1-2)
**Why prioritize over additional architecture:**
- Risk mitigation tools already implemented (memory profiling, inference optimization)
- 8B model represents 2x+ accuracy improvement potential
- Competition requires high accuracy - architectural elegance is secondary
- Strong foundation from 1B implementation reduces implementation risk

### 3. Bridge to Epic 2 (Program Synthesis)
**With 8B baseline established:**
- Epic 2 can build on proven 53%+ accuracy foundation
- Program synthesis benefits from higher-quality base model
- Multi-strategy integration (Epic 3) becomes more effective

## Resource Allocation

### Model Usage (Updated from original plan)
- **Story 1.3**: Sonnet 4 for completion (minimal work remaining)
- **Story 1.5**: Opus 4 for core implementation, Sonnet 4 for validation
- Estimated cost: $3,000-5,000 for Story 1.5 (reduced from original due to preparatory work)

### Risk Mitigation
- All critical risks for Story 1.5 have comprehensive tooling in place
- Memory profiling POC validates 8B feasibility
- Inference optimization frameworks ready for deployment
- Fallback to 7B model validated as contingency

## Competition Impact

### Timeline Advantage
- Removing hexagonal architecture story saves 2-3 weeks
- 8B baseline by end of September enables early Epic 2 start
- Stronger foundation for program synthesis development

### Accuracy Trajectory
- Current: 25% (1B model) â†’ Target: 53%+ (8B model)
- Gap to competition target: 32 percentage points (from 53% to 85%)
- Epic 2-5 must bridge remaining gap through advanced strategies

### Technical Readiness
- Data pipeline exceptional (260K+ tasks/second)
- Infrastructure monitoring proven operational
- Memory management battle-tested
- Ready for advanced strategy development

## Key Success Metrics for Epic 1 Completion

1. **Story 1.3**: Evaluation framework production-ready
2. **Story 1.5**: 53%+ accuracy on validation set with 8B model
3. **Infrastructure**: All monitoring and optimization systems proven
4. **Foundation**: Robust platform for Epic 2 advanced strategies

This revised plan accelerates competitive development while maintaining architectural quality through the excellent foundation already established.
