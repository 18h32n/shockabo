# PRD Completion Summary for ARC Prize 2025

## Final Status
- **PRD Version**: v1.0 Complete
- **Completeness**: 94% (per PM Checklist validation)
- **Total Epics**: 7 (including contingency Epic 7)
- **Total User Stories**: 68 stories across all epics
- **Timeline**: 2 months (Sept 3 - Nov 3, 2025)
- **Team Size**: 2 developers
- **Budget**: $0 (using only free GPU resources)

## Key Enhancements Applied

### 1. Innovation Tournament Results
Applied competitive analysis to select optimal approaches for each epic:
- **Epic 2**: Hybrid Template-MAB Approach for program synthesis
- **Epic 3**: Hierarchical Ensemble with Dynamic Weighting
- **Epic 4**: Transformer-based Task Router for meta-learning
- **Epic 5**: Combined breakthrough techniques (21% theoretical gain)
- **Epic 6**: Chaos Engineering for robustness
- **Epic 7**: Speed-Optimized Multi-Attempt Strategy

### 2. Critique & Refinement Additions
Enhanced key stories with advanced insights:
- Dynamic DSL expansion based on usage patterns (Story 2.1)
- Curriculum TTT for progressive adaptation (Story 3.1)
- Human trace augmentation for imitation learning (Story 3.3)
- Learned feature extraction for task routing (Story 4.1)
- Super-family meta-patterns for hierarchical learning (Story 5.1)
- Failure prediction for preemptive mitigation (Story 6.1)
- Attempt diversity maximization (Story 7.2)

### 3. Quality Standards Maintained
- No testing/documentation trade-offs
- 5 optimization passes in Epic 5
- 95% test coverage requirement
- Comprehensive error handling
- Full API documentation

### 4. Resource Optimization
- Parallel work streams for 2-person team
- Multi-tier LLM strategy (GPT-5 → Gemini → Local models)
- Platform rotation (60 GPU hours/week total)
- Aggressive caching and checkpointing
- Cost tracking to stay under $0.42/task

## Next Steps
The PRD includes specific prompts for:

1. **UX Expert**: Focus on developer experience, monitoring dashboards, and error recovery flows
2. **Architect**: Design modular plugin architecture with clear interfaces for 4 strategies

## Critical Success Factors
1. **Early Validation**: Complete Epic 1 in 2 weeks to validate approach
2. **Parallel Execution**: Start Epic 2 on Day 4 while Epic 1 continues
3. **Breakthrough Required**: Need 15%+ gain from Epic 5 to reach 85%
4. **Fallback Ready**: Epic 7 ensures 75%+ submission if target not met

## Risk Mitigations
1. **Technical**: Using proven approaches (MIT TTT, Berman's evolution)
2. **Resource**: Platform rotation and checkpoint synchronization
3. **Timeline**: Parallel work streams and early starts
4. **Performance**: Multi-tier strategy with graceful degradation
