# 2-Month Zero-Budget Execution Strategy for ARC Prize 2025

## Critical Context
- **Timeline**: Only 2 months remaining (September 3 - November 3, 2025)
- **Budget**: $0 - Must use only free resources
- **Target**: 85% accuracy on ARC-AGI-2 private evaluation set

## Free Resource Stack (Parallel Usage)

### 1. Kaggle Notebooks (Primary)
- **Hardware**: L4x4 GPUs (96GB) - 12 hour sessions
- **Strategy**: Run 2 sessions/day (24hr coverage)
- **Use for**: Final training, ensemble optimization
- **Quota**: Minimum 30 hours/week

### 2. Google Colab (Secondary)
- **Hardware**: T4/A100 GPUs when available
- **Sessions**: ~6-8 hour sessions with cooldowns
- **Strategy**: Rotate 3 Gmail accounts for continuous access
- **Use for**: Rapid prototyping, ablation studies

### 3. Paperspace Gradient (Tertiary)
- **Hardware**: M4000 (8GB) - 6 hour sessions, unlimited restarts
- **Memory**: 30GB RAM (highest among free options)
- **Use for**: Lightweight experiments, data preprocessing

### 4. Lightning.ai (Specialized)
- **Setup**: Apply immediately (24hr approval)
- **Use for**: Collaborative experiments, model sharing

### 5. Local PC (24/7 Background)
- **Tasks**: CPU-based tasks, data analysis, program synthesis DSL development
- **Schedule**: Overnight GPU tasks if available

## Compressed 2-Month Timeline

### Week 1-2: Foundation Sprint (Sept 3-16)
- Day 1-3: Analyze existing SOTA solutions (53% baseline)
- Day 4-7: Implement TTT baseline on Kaggle
- Day 8-14: Build modular architecture + all 4 strategies in parallel

### Week 3-4: Rapid Strategy Development (Sept 17-30)
- Program Synthesis: Local PC (CPU-friendly)
- TTT Enhancement: Kaggle notebooks
- Evolution Strategy: Colab TPUs
- Imitation Learning: Lightning.ai collaboration

### Week 5-6: Integration Blitz (Oct 1-14)
- Meta-learner on Kaggle (needs most memory)
- Ensemble optimization across all platforms
- Parallel hyperparameter search

### Week 7: Final Push (Oct 15-28)
- Competition submission prep
- Final ensemble on Kaggle
- Multiple submission variants

### Week 8: Submission (Oct 29-Nov 3)
- Final validation
- Open source release
- Submit before deadline

## Zero-Budget Platform Rotation Schedule
```
6am-12pm: Kaggle Session 1
12pm-6pm: Colab (Account 1) + PC development  
6pm-12am: Kaggle Session 2
12am-6am: Paperspace + Colab (Account 2)
```

## Resource Multiplication Hacks
1. 3 Google accounts = 3x Colab access
2. Family/friends Kaggle accounts for extra GPU
3. University access if available
4. GitHub Codespaces (60 hrs/month free) as backup
5. Oracle Cloud free tier (4 OCPUs, 24GB) for CPU tasks

## Efficiency Strategies
- Pre-compute everything possible on CPU
- Cache all intermediate results
- Share checkpoints via Google Drive (15GB free)
- Use GitHub for version control
- Leverage Discord community for compute sharing

## Modified Milestones
- **Week 2**: 65% accuracy (TTT baseline)
- **Week 4**: 72% accuracy (multi-strategy)
- **Week 6**: 78% accuracy (ensemble)
- **Week 7**: 82% accuracy (optimization)
- **Week 8**: 85% TARGET

## Quality Preservation (No Compromises)
- Multi-strategy approach via parallel development
- 85% accuracy target
- Interpretability/reasoning traces
- Open source quality

## Smart Shortcuts
- Reuse public implementations (MIT TTT, Berman's evolution)
- Focus on novel combinations vs ground-up builds
- Leverage pre-trained models within competition rules
