# Novel Architecture Ideas for ARC Prize 2025 (Moonshot Approaches)

## Ideas to Revisit if Current Approach Fails

### 1. Quantum-Inspired Superposition Computing
- Maintain multiple solution hypotheses in superposition state
- Use quantum-like interference patterns to amplify correct solutions
- Not actual quantum computing, but borrowing mathematical principles
- **Why interesting**: Could handle ambiguity and multiple valid interpretations naturally
- **Implementation sketch**: Amplitude-based scoring, wave function collapse for decision

### 2. Morphogenetic Programming
- Inspired by biological development processes
- Programs "grow" from seed instructions through developmental stages
- Self-organizing patterns emerge rather than being explicitly programmed
- **Why interesting**: Natural fit for grid transformations that involve growth/spreading patterns
- **Implementation sketch**: Gene regulatory networks, reaction-diffusion systems

### 3. Category Theory-Based Abstract Reasoning
- Model ARC tasks as morphisms between categories
- Use functors and natural transformations for pattern discovery
- Purely mathematical approach without neural components
- **Why interesting**: Captures abstract structure independent of representation
- **Implementation sketch**: Implement basic category operations, learn functors from examples

### 4. Active Inference / Free Energy Principle
- Based on Karl Friston's neuroscience theories
- System minimizes prediction error through active sampling
- Fundamentally different from current supervised/unsupervised paradigms
- **Why interesting**: Unified framework for perception and action, natural curiosity-driven learning
- **Implementation sketch**: Variational inference, generative models with active sampling

## When to Consider These
- If plateau below 70% accuracy with conventional approaches
- If computational budget allows experimental branch
- As ensemble components if main approach reaches ~75%
- For specific task types that resist conventional solutions
