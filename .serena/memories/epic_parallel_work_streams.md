# Epic Parallel Work Streams for ARC Prize 2025

## Overview
This document outlines the parallel work stream strategy for executing epics efficiently with a 2-person team. Each stream is designed to maximize GPU utilization and minimize blocking dependencies.

## Epic 1: Foundation & TTT Baseline (Days 1-14)

### Stream A (Infrastructure) - Team Member A
```
Days 1-3: 
- Story 1.1: Multi-Platform Development Environment
- Story 1.3: Evaluation Framework
- Deliverables: Working environment, accurate evaluation metrics

Days 4-6: 
- Story 1.6: Platform Rotation Automation
- Start Epic 2 DSL design (Day 4)
- Deliverables: Automated platform switching, initial DSL spec

Days 7-10: 
- Integration testing with Stream B
- Platform optimization
- Performance benchmarking
```

### Stream B (ML Implementation) - Team Member B  
```
Days 1-3:
- Story 1.2: ARC Data Pipeline
- Assist with Story 1.1 (Environment setup)
- Deliverables: Efficient data loading, preprocessing ready

Days 4-6:
- Story 1.4: TTT Baseline Implementation (1B model)
- Deliverables: 40%+ accuracy baseline

Days 7-10:
- Story 1.5: Scale to 8B Model
- Integration with Stream A components
- Deliverables: 53%+ accuracy achieved
```

### Synchronization Points
- Day 1: API contract definition
- Day 3: Infrastructure review
- Day 7: Integration begins
- Day 10: Full system test

### Parallel Start Points for Epic 2
- **Day 4**: DSL design can begin (Member A)
- **Day 7**: Program templates can begin (Member B)
- **Day 10**: Full synthesis development

## Epic 2: Program Synthesis Engine (Days 10-21)

### Stream A (DSL & Evolution) - Team Member A
```
Days 4-7 (Early Start):
- DSL design and core operations
- Basic genetic algorithm framework

Days 10-14:
- Evolutionary search implementation
- Fitness function design
- Population diversity mechanisms

Days 15-21:
- LLM-guided generation integration
- Performance optimization
```

### Stream B (Generation & Testing) - Team Member B
```
Days 7-10 (Early Start):
- Program template creation
- Basic synthesis testing

Days 10-14:
- Python function generator
- Integration with GPT-5/Gemini
- Caching system

Days 15-21:
- Full synthesis pipeline
- 500+ programs per task
```

## Epic 3: Multi-Strategy Integration (Week 3-4)

### Parallel Strategy Development
Both team members take 2 strategies each:

**Member A**: 
- Enhanced TTT improvements
- Evolutionary program discovery

**Member B**:
- Imitation learning from traces
- Hybrid neural-symbolic pipeline

### Integration Week
- Days 1-3: Individual strategy development
- Days 4-5: Pairwise integration testing
- Days 6-7: Full ensemble implementation

## Critical Success Factors

### Communication Protocol
- Daily 15-min standup at 9 AM
- Shared Slack/Discord channel
- Git commits every 2-3 hours
- Blockers flagged immediately

### Resource Management
- GPU calendar shared between members
- Platform credentials managed centrally
- API keys in shared secure vault
- Checkpoint naming convention

### Quality Gates
- Code review before integration
- Test coverage maintained at 95%
- Performance benchmarks at each merge
- Documentation updated with code

## Risk Mitigation

### Single Point of Failure Prevention
- Cross-training sessions weekly
- Detailed documentation for each stream
- Backup person identified for critical tasks
- All code in shared repository

### Platform Availability
- 3 platforms per person (6 total)
- Staggered usage to avoid limits
- Local development fallback ready
- CPU-only mode for emergencies

### Integration Risks
- API contracts in writing Day 1
- Mock implementations for testing
- Integration tests from Day 3
- Continuous Integration pipeline

## Efficiency Metrics

### Time Savings
- Epic 1: 3-4 days saved
- Epic 2: 5-7 days saved (early start)
- Epic 3: 50% faster with parallel strategies
- Total: ~2 weeks acceleration

### Resource Utilization
- GPU usage: 85-90% (vs 60% sequential)
- Both team members productive: 95%
- Blocking time: <5% of total
- Platform rotation: Fully automated

This parallel approach enables us to maintain quality while dramatically accelerating development within our 2-month timeline.
