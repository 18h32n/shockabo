- **Opus 4**: 15% of tasks - Breakthrough capabilities, critical decisions

### Cost Optimization
- **Total Estimated Cost**: $15,000-$25,000 for complete development
- **Critical Path**: Focus Opus 4 on breakthrough capabilities (Epics 4-5)
- **ROI Focus**: Opus 4 reserved for 85% accuracy breakthrough features

### Timeline Considerations
- **Epic 1-2**: Foundation (4-6 weeks) - Critical for competition entry
- **Epic 3-4**: Enhancement (6-8 weeks) - Competitive advantage  
- **Epic 5**: Breakthrough (4-6 weeks) - 85% accuracy target
- **Epic 6-7**: Finalization (2-3 weeks) - Competition readiness

### Risk Mitigation
- **Parallel execution** maximizes development speed
- **Optional QA steps** marked based on risk/complexity analysis
- **Critical checkpoints** use Opus 4 for maximum quality assurance
- **Breakthrough focus** on Epics 4-5 for 85% accuracy target

### Competition Constraints
- **12-hour runtime limit** - Ultra-fast inference mode (Story 7.2)
- **Kaggle L4x4 GPUs** - Budget-aware optimization (Story 4.3)
- **No internet access** - Complete offline capability required
- **Open source requirement** - Release preparation (Story 6.4)

## Next Immediate Actions
1. **Implement Epic 1** - Get foundational architecture working
2. **Scale TTT approach** - Move from experimental to production-ready  
3. **Build evaluation pipeline** - Automated testing and benchmarking
4. **Develop program synthesis** - Key differentiator for breakthrough performance
5. **Create ensemble system** - Combine multiple strategies for optimal results

This plan balances development speed, cost efficiency, and the aggressive 85% accuracy target required for ARC Prize 2025 success.
