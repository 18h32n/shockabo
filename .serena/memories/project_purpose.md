# ARC Prize 2025 - Project Purpose

## Competition Overview
The ARC Prize 2025 is a $825,000+ Kaggle competition aimed at creating artificial general intelligence through novel reasoning capabilities. The competition runs from March 26 to November 3, 2025.

## Primary Goal
Achieve **85% accuracy** on the ARC-AGI-2 private evaluation dataset - a benchmark that tests fluid intelligence and skill acquisition outside training data.

## Key Challenge
Unlike traditional AI benchmarks that test memorized knowledge, ARC-AGI requires novel reasoning on abstract visual tasks. Each task consists of:
- 3-5 training examples showing input/output grid transformations
- 1 test input requiring prediction of the correct output
- Tasks test pattern recognition, spatial reasoning, and logical inference

## Dataset Structure
- **Public Training Set**: 1,000 tasks for algorithm development
- **Public Evaluation Set**: 120 tasks for performance testing  
- **Semi-Private Evaluation Set**: 120 tasks for leaderboard rankings
- **Private Evaluation Set**: 120 tasks for final competition scoring

## Success Metrics
- Must provide exactly 2 prediction attempts per task
- Final score = (Number of correct predictions) / (Total task outputs)
- Computational budget constraint: ~$0.42 per task
- All solutions must be open-sourced

## Current State of Art
- Human performance: 73-77% average
- Best AI performance: 53% (2024 competition winner)
- Target breakthrough: 85% accuracy representing human-level AGI reasoning
