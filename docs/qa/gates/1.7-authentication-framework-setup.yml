# Final assessment
overall_assessment: |
  This authentication framework implementation demonstrates exceptional quality and serves as an
  exemplary reference for secure authentication systems. The comprehensive security measures,
  thorough testing coverage, excellent documentation, and production-ready architecture exceed
  expectations for this story scope.
  
  The implementation successfully addresses all security concerns with industry best practices,
  provides comprehensive testing coverage, and includes detailed documentation with practical
  examples. No blocking issues were identified, and the few minor enhancement opportunities
  are appropriately categorized as future improvements.
  
  This work is ready for production deployment and sets a high standard for future development.
