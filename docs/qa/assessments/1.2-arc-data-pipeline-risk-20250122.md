## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. PERF-001: 10-Second Load Time Requirement
**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Loading 1000 tasks with complex data structures in 10 seconds is extremely challenging
**Impact**: High - Failure blocks entire development pipeline and competition viability
**Mitigation**:
- Implement parallel loading with multiprocessing
- Use memory-mapped files for large datasets
- Pre-compute and cache task metadata
- Profile every data access path
**Testing Focus**: Performance benchmarks from day one, continuous monitoring

### 2. PERF-002: 4GB Memory Limit
**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - ARC tasks with large grids can quickly consume memory
**Impact**: High - Memory overflow crashes in Kaggle/Colab environments
**Mitigation**:
- Implement sparse matrix representation early
- Use lazy loading for task data
- Stream processing for batch operations
- Memory profiling in all test environments
**Testing Focus**: Memory usage tests under various load scenarios

## High Priority Risks

### 3. TECH-001: Integration with task_loader.py
**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Unknown interface compatibility issues
**Impact**: High - Core functionality depends on this integration
**Mitigation**:
- Create interface contracts early
- Build adapter pattern for flexibility
- Comprehensive integration tests
**Testing Focus**: Contract testing, interface validation

### 4. DATA-001: Data Augmentation Semantic Corruption
**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: High - Grid transformations can break task logic
**Impact**: Medium - Invalid training data corrupts model learning
**Mitigation**:
- Validate augmentations preserve task relationships
- Create augmentation constraints based on task type
- Manual review of augmented samples
**Testing Focus**: Semantic integrity validation tests

### 5. OPS-001: Cache Invalidation Complexity
**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: High - Complex dependencies between cached items
**Impact**: Medium - Stale cache data causes incorrect results
**Mitigation**:
- Implement versioned cache keys
- Clear invalidation policies
- Cache warming strategies
**Testing Focus**: Cache consistency tests

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Load 1000 tasks timing tests
- **Memory Profiling**: Track memory usage across operations
- **Stress Testing**: Maximum dataset size handling
- **Platform Testing**: Validate on Kaggle/Colab environments

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests
- **Integration Tests**: task_loader.py compatibility
- **Augmentation Validation**: Semantic preservation tests
- **Cache Consistency**: Invalidation and refresh tests
- **Edge Cases**: Empty grids, massive grids, corrupted data

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests
- **Unit Tests**: Individual component validation
- **Serialization Tests**: Format compatibility
- **Type Safety**: Validation of data structures
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- PERF-001: Must achieve < 10 second load time
- PERF-002: Must stay under 4GB memory usage
- TECH-001: Must integrate with task_loader.py

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- DATA-001: If augmentation validation in place
- OPS-001: If cache monitoring implemented
- PERF-003: If batch sizes configurable

### Accepted Risks
- Minor serialization overhead (use fastest libraries)
- Platform-specific optimizations deferred
- Advanced monitoring features deferred

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- **Load time metrics**: Track p50, p95, p99 load times
- **Memory usage**: Peak and sustained memory consumption
- **Cache hit rates**: Effectiveness of caching strategy
- **Error rates**: Data loading failures, augmentation errors
- **Performance degradation**: Trending over time

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- Performance requirements change
- New data formats introduced
- Memory constraints modified
- Integration points change
- Augmentation strategies updated
