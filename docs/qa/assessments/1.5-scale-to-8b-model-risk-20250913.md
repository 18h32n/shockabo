Date: 2025-09-13
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 10
- Critical Risks: 2
- High Risks: 3
- Medium Risks: 3
- Low Risks: 2
- Risk Score: 11/100 (Critical - Immediate attention required)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. PERF-001: GPU Memory Exhaustion

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - 8B models typically require 16-32GB just for weights, QLoRA helps but margins are thin
**Impact**: High - Complete failure to load or train model, blocking all progress
**Mitigation**:
- Implement aggressive quantization (4-bit NF4)
- Use gradient checkpointing on every layer if needed
- Consider model sharding across GPUs if available
- Implement dynamic batch size reduction
- Pre-validate memory requirements before full load
**Testing Focus**: Memory profiling at each stage, OOM recovery testing

### 2. PERF-002: Inference Time Exceeds 7.2 Minutes

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - 8B model inference is inherently slow without optimization
**Impact**: High - Fails core acceptance criteria, competition disqualification
**Mitigation**:
- Implement inference optimizations (torch.compile, better-transformers)
- Use key-value caching for attention
- Optimize prompt engineering to reduce tokens
- Consider distillation to smaller model if needed
- Profile and optimize hot paths
**Testing Focus**: Performance benchmarking on representative tasks

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests
- Memory usage profiling throughout pipeline
- Performance benchmarking on diverse ARC tasks
- OOM recovery and graceful degradation testing
- Inference optimization validation
- End-to-end timing tests

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests
- Mixed precision stability tests
- Checkpoint save/restore validation
- QLoRA configuration sweep testing
- Training convergence monitoring
- Error recovery scenarios

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests
- Validation set statistical analysis
- Batch size adaptation testing
- Security audit of model storage
- Hardware compatibility checks

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- PERF-001: Must demonstrate stable model loading within 24GB
- PERF-002: Must achieve <7.2 minute inference consistently
- TECH-001: Must show stable training for 1000+ steps

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- OPS-001: Acceptable with manual recovery procedures documented
- TECH-002: Acceptable if 53% accuracy achieved
- DATA-001: Acceptable with clear documentation of limitations

### Accepted Risks
- BUS-001: Assume proper hardware is available
- SEC-001: Standard security practices sufficient

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- GPU memory usage (alert at 90% threshold)
- Inference latency percentiles (p50, p95, p99)
- Training loss curves and NaN detection
- Checkpoint success rates
- Model accuracy drift

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- Model architecture changes
- Hardware constraints change
- New optimization techniques available
- Training instabilities observed
- Competition requirements updated
