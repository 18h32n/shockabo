## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 12
- Critical Risks: 2
- High Risks: 3
- Medium Risks: 4
- Low Risks: 3
- Risk Score: 21/100 (High Risk)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. PERF-001: Real-time Dashboard Performance Bottleneck
**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - WebSocket streaming of multiple metrics across concurrent experiments likely to overwhelm browser with 500ms update requirement
**Impact**: High - Dashboard unusable under load, blocking effective model development iteration
**Mitigation**:
- Implement data throttling and aggregation at server level
- Use time-series downsampling for historical data
- Add client-side buffering and batch updates
- Implement progressive loading for large datasets
**Testing Focus**: Load test with 100+ concurrent metrics streams, measure client CPU/memory usage

### 2. DATA-001: W&B API Key Exposure Risk
**Score: 9 (Critical)**  
**Probability**: High - Developers often accidentally commit credentials, especially in multi-platform setup
**Impact**: High - Exposed API key could lead to data breach, usage abuse, account compromise
**Mitigation**:
- Implement pre-commit hooks to scan for API keys
- Use environment variable validation on startup
- Add .env.example with clear setup instructions
- Implement credential rotation reminders
- Add automated secret scanning in CI/CD
**Testing Focus**: Security testing for credential leakage, environment variable validation

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests
- **Performance Testing**: Simulate 100+ concurrent WebSocket connections with continuous metric streams
- **Security Testing**: Automated credential scanning, environment variable injection tests
- **Load Testing**: Dashboard with 10,000+ metrics points, measure rendering performance
- **Stress Testing**: W&B API rate limiting and error handling

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests
- **Memory Leak Testing**: Long-running evaluation sessions with memory profiling
- **Integration Testing**: W&B usage tracking and limit alerts at 80%, 95% thresholds
- **Connection Resilience**: WebSocket reconnection under various network conditions
- **Data Integrity**: Evaluation result persistence and recovery testing

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests
- **Format Validation**: Competition submission format compatibility checks
- **Algorithm Performance**: Regression detection with various dataset sizes
- **Cross-Platform**: Environment setup validation on Kaggle, Colab, local
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of evaluation crashes

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- All critical risks (PERF-001, DATA-001)
- W&B credential security implementation
- Basic dashboard performance optimization

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- WebSocket stability with reconnection logic
- W&B usage monitoring with manual checks
- Competition format with validation suite

### Accepted Risks
- Minor dashboard lag under extreme load (documented limitation)
- Manual W&B usage monitoring until automated alerts implemented

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- Dashboard response times (target < 500ms)
- WebSocket connection stability metrics
- W&B API usage and remaining quota
- Memory usage trends for evaluation engine
- Security alerts for credential access patterns

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- Adding new real-time metrics to dashboard
- Changing WebSocket implementation
- Modifying W&B integration patterns
- Updating evaluation algorithms
- Scaling to larger datasets

## Recommendations

### Testing Priority
1. Performance test dashboard with production-scale data
2. Security audit for credential management
3. Integration test W&B with usage limits
4. Stress test evaluation engine memory usage

### Development Focus
1. Implement robust credential management first
2. Add performance monitoring before dashboard features
3. Design for horizontal scaling from start
4. Add comprehensive error handling for integrations

### Deployment Strategy
1. Deploy with feature flags for dashboard components
2. Gradual rollout with performance monitoring
3. W&B integration with fallback to local storage
4. Canary deployment for WebSocket changes

### Monitoring Setup
1. Real-time dashboard performance metrics
2. W&B usage alerts at 80% and 95%
3. WebSocket connection health dashboard
4. Memory usage trends and leak detection
