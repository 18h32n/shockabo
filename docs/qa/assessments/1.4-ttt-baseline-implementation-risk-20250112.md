- Critical Risks: 3
- High Risks: 4
- Medium Risks: 4
- Low Risks: 3
- Risk Score: 6/100 (Extremely High Risk)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. PERF-001: GPU Memory Exhaustion During Training
**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - 1B model with LoRA on 16GB GPU leaves minimal headroom for training operations
**Impact**: High - Training crashes, inability to complete baseline, blocks all dependent work
**Mitigation**:
- Implement aggressive gradient checkpointing
- Use 8-bit/4-bit quantization for base model
- Dynamic batch size adjustment based on available memory
- Implement memory profiling hooks throughout training
- Add OOM prevention with automatic batch size reduction
**Testing Focus**: Memory stress testing with varying batch sizes, long training runs

### 2. TECH-001: MIT TTT Codebase Integration Complexity
**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Adapting external research code to production architecture often reveals hidden dependencies
**Impact**: High - Integration failure blocks entire TTT approach, requires architecture redesign
**Mitigation**:
- Create comprehensive adapter layer with clear interfaces
- Document all MIT TTT assumptions and dependencies
- Implement fallback to simpler baseline if integration fails
- Add extensive integration tests for data format conversions
- Version control integration points for rollback capability
**Testing Focus**: Integration testing with edge cases, data format validation

### 3. BUS-001: 40% Accuracy Target Unrealistic for 1B Model
**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Current SOTA results suggest 1B models achieve ~20-25% on ARC tasks
**Impact**: High - Failure to meet acceptance criteria blocks story completion, damages team confidence
**Mitigation**:
- Negotiate realistic accuracy target (25-30%) for 1B baseline
- Focus on subset of easier tasks for initial validation
- Document learning progression, not just final accuracy
- Implement ensemble approaches to boost performance
- Prepare clear migration path to larger models
**Testing Focus**: Accuracy validation on task difficulty subsets, learning curve analysis

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests
- **Memory Stress Testing**: Profile memory usage throughout training lifecycle
- **Integration Testing**: Validate MIT TTT adapter with production data pipeline
- **Accuracy Benchmarking**: Test on stratified task difficulty sets
- **OOM Recovery Testing**: Verify graceful handling of memory exhaustion

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests
- **Time Constraint Testing**: Full training runs with timing benchmarks
- **LoRA Compatibility**: Test with different model architectures
- **Checkpoint Integrity**: Corruption testing under memory pressure
- **Platform Testing**: CUDA compatibility across Kaggle/Colab/local

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests
- **Convergence Testing**: Learning rate scheduling validation
- **Quantization Impact**: Accuracy loss measurement
- **Data Format Testing**: Edge case handling in adapters
