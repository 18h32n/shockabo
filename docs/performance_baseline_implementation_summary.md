## Usage Examples

### Creating Performance Baselines
```bash
# Create comprehensive baselines for current version
python scripts/create_performance_baselines.py

# Output: Baselines stored in performance_baselines/baselines_2.4.0.json
# Report: performance_baselines/reports/baseline_creation_report_2.4.0.json
```

### Performance Comparison
```bash
# Compare current version against baseline
python scripts/performance_comparison.py --baseline "2.4.0" --current "2.5.0"

# Exit codes:
# 0: No regressions detected
# 1: Warning-level regressions
# 2: Critical regressions (block deployment)
```

### Test Suite Validation
```bash
# Run comprehensive test suite
python scripts/test_performance_baselines.py

# Tests all components end-to-end
# Validates regression detection logic
# Verifies target compliance checking
```
