# 1. Introduction

This document defines the backend architecture for the ARC Prize 2025 competition system. Our goal is to achieve 85% accuracy on ARC-AGI-2 abstract reasoning tasks through a sophisticated multi-strategy AI system operating within strict budget constraints.

## Key Objectives
- Achieve 85% accuracy on ARC-AGI-2 tasks
- Operate within $0.42 per task budget limit  
- Support rapid experimentation and iteration
- Enable platform-agnostic deployment across free GPU providers
- Maintain clean separation of concerns through hexagonal architecture

## Scope
This document covers the backend system architecture including:
- Multi-strategy reasoning system (MSRS) design
- API and service layer specifications
- Data models and database schema
- Infrastructure and deployment strategies
- Security and monitoring approaches
