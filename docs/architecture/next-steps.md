# 16. Next Steps

## Immediate Actions
1. **Initialize Project Structure**
   ```bash
   python scripts/init_project.py
   ```

2. **Set Up Development Environment**
   - Configure pre-commit hooks for security checks
   - Install development dependencies
   - Set up local SQLite database

3. **Begin Core Implementation**
   - Start with domain models and repository interfaces
   - Implement basic CRUD operations for ARC tasks
   - Create initial version of Strategy Router

## Short-term Priorities (Week 1-2)
- Implement Test-Time Training adapter
- Set up experiment tracking system
- Create basic evaluation pipeline
- Establish CI/CD for automated testing

## Integration Points
- **Frontend Architecture**: If frontend is needed, key integration points:
  - REST API endpoints defined in Section 7
  - WebSocket connection for real-time updates
  - Authentication tokens via JWT
  - CORS configuration for local development

## Handoff Notes for Frontend Team
- API base URL: Configurable via environment
- Authentication: Bearer token in Authorization header
- Real-time updates: Socket.IO on same port
- Error format: Consistent JSON structure (see Section 11)

## Performance Benchmarks to Track
- Task processing time: Target < 30s average
- Memory usage: Stay under platform limits
- API response time: < 200ms for queries
- Model inference: < 5s per prediction

## Technical Debt Management
- **Rapid Prototyping Phase**: Prioritize functionality over code quality during Weeks 1-6
- **Code Quality Gates**: Implement linting/type checking but defer refactoring until post-competition
- **Known Debt Areas**: Platform-specific code, hardcoded configurations, experimental features
- **Debt Tracking**: Document refactoring opportunities in code comments with "# TODO: TECH-DEBT"
- **Post-Competition Cleanup**: Allocate 2 weeks for refactoring before open-source release

## Post-Competition Considerations
- **Open Source Release**: Clean up experimental code, improve documentation, add contribution guidelines
- **Long-term Maintenance**: Extract reusable components into separate libraries
- **Performance Optimization**: Profile and optimize code paths identified during competition
- **Architecture Improvements**: Refactor platform-specific code into pluggable adapters
- **Community Integration**: Prepare codebase for external contributions and extensions
