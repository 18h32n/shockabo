# 15. Architect Checklist Results

Running comprehensive architecture validation checklist...

## ✅ Completeness Check
- [x] All required sections present and populated
- [x] No placeholders or TODO items remaining
- [x] Comprehensive coverage of backend architecture aspects

## ✅ Consistency Check  
- [x] Naming conventions consistent throughout (snake_case for Python)
- [x] Technology choices align with constraints (Python 3.12.7 only)
- [x] Architectural patterns consistently applied (hexagonal architecture)

## ✅ Feasibility Check
- [x] Zero-budget constraint addressed with platform rotation strategy
- [x] All technologies available on free platforms (Kaggle/Colab/Paperspace)
- [x] Resource limits realistic for competition constraints

## ✅ Scalability Check
- [x] Horizontal scaling through distributed task processing
- [x] Database design supports partitioning by task_id
- [x] Caching strategies reduce redundant computation

## ✅ Security Check
- [x] Authentication/authorization defined
- [x] Data validation at all entry points
- [x] Automated security fixes implemented
- [x] Secrets management via environment variables

## ✅ Integration Check
- [x] Clean interfaces defined between layers
- [x] External API integration patterns specified
- [x] Event-driven architecture enables loose coupling

## ✅ Best Practices Check
- [x] SOLID principles followed in design
- [x] DRY principle applied to reduce duplication
- [x] Separation of concerns maintained

## ⚠️ Risk Assessment
- **Medium Risk**: Platform switching complexity
  - Mitigation: Checkpoint coordination system
- **Low Risk**: API rate limits
  - Mitigation: Circuit breaker and retry logic
- **Low Risk**: Model size constraints
  - Mitigation: Quantization and pruning strategies
