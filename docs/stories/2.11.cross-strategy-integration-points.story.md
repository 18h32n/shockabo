**Strategy Port Interface** [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md, components-and-services.md]

**CRITICAL - FILE DOES NOT EXIST YET:**
Location: `src/domain/ports/strategy.py` (TO BE CREATED in Task 1)

Required interface to create:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
import numpy as np

class StrategyPort(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def solve_task(self, task: ARCTask) -> StrategyOutput:
        """Solve an ARC task and return standardized output."""

        """Estimate resource requirements."""
        pass
```

**Hexagonal Architecture Integration** [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md]

**DEPENDENCY NOTICE:** Most integration points are Epic 3 scope

The program synthesis adapter must implement the StrategyPort interface to integrate with:

- Domain Services: `strategy_router.py`, `task_processor.py`, `experiment_orchestrator.py` (Epic 3 scope)
- Other Strategy Adapters: `ttt_adapter.py`, `imitation_learning.py` (Epic 3 scope)
- External APIs via REST API routes in `src/adapters/api/routes/strategies.py` (Epic 1 or 3 scope - NOT VERIFIED)

**Ensemble Integration Requirements** [Source: docs/prd/epic-3-multi-strategy-integration.md:78-91 - VERIFIED]

**DEPENDENCY NOTICE:** Ensemble components are Epic 3 scope (future implementation)

From Epic 3.5 (Hierarchical Ensemble Mechanism):

- Three-level hierarchical combination structure
- Learned weights at each hierarchy level
- Task-type aware weight adjustment
- Ensemble decision in <200ms
- Integration point: `src/domain/services/ensemble_manager.py` (TO BE CREATED IN EPIC 3)

From Epic 3.8 (Unified Probabilistic Output Format):

- Numpy array format for predictions (30x30 grids)
- Per-pixel confidence scores (0.0-1.0)
- Strategy-specific confidence scores dictionary
- Optional reasoning trace for debugging
- 100x faster than object-based formats
- Direct compatibility with RouterEval
- Weighted ensemble voting support

**REST API Integration** [Source: architecture/rest-api-specification.md]

**DEPENDENCY NOTICE:** REST API endpoints are Epic 1 scope
**FILE STATUS:** `src/adapters/api/routes/strategies.py` does NOT exist yet (Epic 1 or 3 deliverable)

Planned endpoints for future integration:

- POST /tasks/submit - Task submission endpoint
- POST /strategies/evaluate - Strategy evaluation endpoint
- GET /experiments/{experiment_id}/status - Experiment tracking

Expected integration flow:

1. Client submits task via POST /tasks/submit
2. Strategy router evaluates available strategies
3. Program synthesis returns StrategyOutput
4. Ensemble combines outputs from all strategies
5. Best prediction selected and returned to client

**Timing Synchronization Requirements** [Source: prd/epic-2-program-synthesis-engine.md, epic-3-multi-strategy-integration.md]

Program synthesis constraints:

- Complete search in under 5 minutes per task (AC #3 from Story 2.5)
- 500+ programs generated and evaluated

TTT strategy constraints (from Epic 3.1):

- Reduce inference time to <5 minutes per task
- Memory efficient batch processing

Timing coordination requirements:

- Parallel execution of strategies with shared time budget
- Early termination when any strategy finds high-confidence solution
- Resource budgeting to prevent conflicts (CPU/GPU/API)
- Progress reporting for monitoring

**Monitoring and Metrics Requirements** [Source: docs/prd/epic-3-multi-strategy-integration.md:92-105 - VERIFIED]

**FILE STATUS:** `src/infrastructure/monitoring.py` does NOT exist yet (to be created in Task 4)

From Story 3.6 (Strategy Performance Profiler):

- Track accuracy by task type/difficulty
- Measure inference time and resource usage
- Identify complementary strategy pairs (Epic 3 scope)
- Real-time performance dashboard (Epic 3 scope - deferred)
- Export data for meta-learning (Epic 3 scope)

Prometheus metrics to implement in Task 4:

- `strategy_solve_duration_seconds{strategy="program_synthesis"}` - Histogram
- `strategy_accuracy{strategy="program_synthesis", task_type="..."}` - Gauge
- `strategy_confidence_score{strategy="program_synthesis"}` - Histogram
- `strategy_resource_usage{strategy="program_synthesis", resource="..."}` - Gauge
- `strategy_api_calls_total{strategy="program_synthesis", tier="..."}` - Counter

**Logging Standards** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**FILE STATUS:** `src/infrastructure/logging.py` does NOT exist yet (to be created in Task 5)

Target location: `src/infrastructure/logging.py` (NEW FILE)

Structlog configuration to implement:

- JSON structured logging
- Log levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
- Context: task_id, strategy_type, correlation_id

Expected log format:

```python
log.info(
    "strategy_execution_complete",
    strategy="program_synthesis",
    task_id=task.task_id,
    correlation_id=correlation_id,
    confidence=output.confidence_score,
    processing_time_ms=output.processing_time_ms,
    programs_evaluated=len(programs)
)
```

**Error Handling Patterns** [Source: architecture/error-handling.md (implied from source tree)]

Expected error handling:

- Timeout errors: Return partial results with lower confidence
- Resource exhaustion: Graceful degradation to smaller population
- API failures: Use cached results or fallback models
- Invalid input: Validation errors with clear messages

**Performance Requirements**

Output format performance (AC #1):

- Serialization: <10ms for 30x30 grid with confidence scores (msgpack binary format)
- Memory: <1MB per StrategyOutput object
- Baseline comparison: Current ARCTaskSolution with nested lists serializes in ~500-1000ms for complex outputs
- Target: 100x faster (5-10ms) using numpy arrays + msgpack vs nested Python lists + JSON
- Measurement methodology: Benchmark against ARCTaskSolution serialization in Subtask 1.6

Confidence scoring performance (AC #2):

- Calculation: <50ms per confidence score
- Calibration: Pre-computed lookup tables for speed
- Aggregation: <10ms for combining multiple program confidences

Timing coordination performance (AC #3):

- Coordination overhead: <100ms total
- Early termination latency: <500ms from signal to stop
- Progress reporting: <50ms per update

### Security Considerations

**Untrusted Strategy Output Validation:**

- Validate numpy array shapes before deserialization (max 30x30)
- Validate confidence scores are in valid range (0.0-1.0)
- Sanitize reasoning traces to prevent log injection
- Implement resource limits on strategy execution (timeout, memory)

**Timing Coordination Attack Prevention:**

- Prevent resource exhaustion via early termination abuse
- Validate timing signals come from authorized strategies
- Implement rate limiting on progress reporting

**Metrics Collection Security:**

- Sanitize metric labels to prevent Prometheus injection
- Validate correlation IDs format to prevent log forgery
- Limit reasoning trace size to prevent memory exhaustion (max 100 entries)

**Trust Boundaries:**

- Strategy outputs are untrusted until validated
- Cross-strategy signals must be authenticated
- Metrics data is trusted only after sanitization

    def __init__(self,
                 success_rate: float = 0.5,
                 min_delay_ms: int = 1000,

- TestPerformanceRequirements validates serialization <10ms (test_cross_strategy_integration.py:276-292)
- TestPerformanceRequirements validates metrics <1ms (test_cross_strategy_integration.py:294-305)
- 100x speedup over JSON baseline achieved via msgpack + numpy

**Scalability:**

- Thread-safe metrics collection supports concurrent strategies
- Context var based logging has minimal overhead
- Prometheus export scales linearly with metric count

**No Performance Issues Found**

### Files Modified During Review

**Refactored for Code Quality:**

1. src/adapters/strategies/confidence_calculator.py (line length compliance)
2. src/infrastructure/monitoring.py (complexity reduction + type annotations)
3. src/infrastructure/logging.py (type annotations + line length)
4. src/domain/ports/timing.py (generic type parameter)

**Developer Action Required:** Please update File List in Dev Agent Record section to reflect QA refactoring.
