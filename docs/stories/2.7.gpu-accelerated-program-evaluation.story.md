**Data Models** [Source: architecture/data-models.md]
Extend existing models:

```python
@dataclass
class ResourceUsage:
    gpu_memory_mb: Optional[float]  # Already defined at line 84
```

New models needed:

- `BatchEvaluationRequest`: Groups programs for GPU evaluation

- `DeviceCapabilities`: Store GPU specifications and limits

**Integration Points**

- EvaluationService: Add batch evaluation method
  ```python
  async def batch_evaluate(
      self,
      programs: List[DSLProgram],
      test_inputs: List[Grid],
      device: str = "auto"  # "cuda", "cpu", or "auto"
  ) -> List[EvaluationResult]:
      """Evaluate multiple programs in parallel on GPU/CPU"""
  ```
- Evolution Engine: Replace sequential evaluation with batch calls
- Strategy Interface: Extend with GPU-aware evaluation options
- Monitoring: Add GPU-specific metrics to Prometheus

### Technical Constraints

**GPU Memory Limits** [AC #3]

- Maximum 8GB VRAM for batch processing
- Kaggle: Tesla P100 (16GB) or T4 (15GB) - safe margin
- Colab: Tesla T4 (15GB) typical allocation
- Paperspace: Variable, assume 8GB minimum

**Performance Requirements** [AC #4]

- Target: 10x speedup over CPU baseline
- Batch size: 100 programs in parallel
- Evaluation time: <50ms per batch (vs 500ms sequential CPU)
- Memory transfer overhead: <10% of total time

**Platform Compatibility** [AC #5]

- CUDA support: PyTorch with CUDA 11.8+
- CPU fallback: Maintain feature parity
- Platform detection: Automatic based on environment

### Platform-Specific Considerations

**Kaggle GPU Environment** [Source: architecture/infrastructure.md]

- 30 GPU hours per week [Line 11]
- Setup script: `scripts/platform_deploy/kaggle_setup.py` [Line 13]
- Pre-installed: PyTorch with CUDA support

**Colab GPU Environment**

- 12 GPU hours per day [Line 17]
- Automatic GPU allocation, may disconnect
- Requires runtime type selection

**Platform-Specific GPU Setup**

**Kaggle GPU Setup:**

```python
# Auto-detected, but can force with:
import torch
torch.cuda.set_device(0)  # Tesla P100 or T4
```

**Colab GPU Setup:**

```python
# Requires runtime change to GPU
# Runtime > Change runtime type > Hardware accelerator > GPU
if not torch.cuda.is_available():
    raise RuntimeError("GPU runtime not enabled in Colab")
```

**Paperspace GPU Setup:**

```python
# Gradient notebooks auto-configure GPU
# For custom instances, may need:
os.environ['CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES'] = '0'
```

**Vectorization Strategy**
Grid operations to vectorize:

1. Transformations: rotate, flip, mirror (matrix operations)
2. Color operations: mapping, filtering (lookup tables)
3. Pattern matching: convolutions, template matching
4. Shape detection: connected components (parallel algorithms)
