- Language: Python 3.12.7 (exclusive)
- Validation: Pydantic v2 for type safety
- Serialization: msgpack, orjson for efficient serialization
- Testing: pytest, pytest-asyncio
- Linting: ruff, mypy for type checking

**Project Structure** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

- DSL core implementation: `src/domain/services/` (create new `dsl_engine.py`)
- DSL operations: Create new directory `src/domain/dsl/` for operation modules
- DSL adapters: `src/adapters/strategies/program_synthesis.py` (will use DSL)
- Tests: `tests/unit/domain/dsl/` for DSL operation tests
- Utils: Can leverage existing `src/utils/grid_ops.py` for grid utilities

**Existing Grid Operations** [Source: src/utils/grid_ops.py]

- `grid_to_string()` and `string_to_grid()` for LLM-friendly representations
- `SparseGridConverter` for memory-efficient sparse matrix operations
- Grid operations should integrate with these existing utilities

**Domain Models** [Source: architecture/data-models.md]

- Use `ARCTask` model which contains:
  - `train_examples: List[Dict[str, List[List[int]]]]`
  - `test_input: List[List[int]]`
  - Grid values are integers 0-9 representing colors
- Programs will be executed by `StrategyType.PROGRAM_SYNTHESIS`

**Coding Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

- Use Black formatter with line length 100
- Use type hints for all function signatures
- Follow PEP 8 conventions
- Document with docstrings including usage examples
- Mark experimental code with TODO: TECH-DEBT comments

**Performance Considerations**

- Grid operations must be efficient for grids up to 30x30
- Memory limit of 100MB per execution (from AC)
- Execution timeout of 1 second per function (from Story 2.4 AC)
- Consider using numpy for vectorized operations where applicable

### Testing

**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/test-strategy.md]

- Test file location: `tests/unit/domain/dsl/test_*.py`
- Use pytest framework with pytest-asyncio for async tests
- Follow testing pyramid: 70% unit tests, 25% integration, 5% E2E
- Each DSL operation requires dedicated unit test file
- Use parameterized tests for operation variations
- Include property-based testing with hypothesis where applicable
