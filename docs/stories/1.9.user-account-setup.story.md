## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

- Story 1.8 focuses on CI/CD pipeline setup, requiring secure credential management
- Story 1.7 successfully implemented authentication framework with JWT tokens and environment variable management patterns
- Previous stories established foundation for secure credential storage using environment variables
- Platform rotation automation from Story 1.6 requires service accounts and API keys for automated access

### Data Models

- No specific data models required for account setup process [Source: architecture/data-models.md]
- User account information will be stored in external platforms, not in local database

### API Specifications

- API keys and service account credentials will be used for external platform authentication [Source: architecture/rest-api-specification.md]
- No internal API endpoints need to be implemented for this story
- External API endpoints to be tested: Kaggle API, W&B API, GCS API, Paperspace API

### Component Specifications

- Environment variable configuration files in project root [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- Credential storage utilities in src/infrastructure/config.py [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- Platform setup scripts in scripts/platform_deploy/ [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

### File Locations

- Environment variables template: .env.example [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- Platform setup scripts: scripts/platform_deploy/kaggle_setup.py, colab_setup.py, paperspace_setup.py [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- Configuration management: src/infrastructure/config.py [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- Documentation: docs/deployment/ directory for setup guides [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

### Testing

**Test File Locations**: tests/ directory with unit/, integration/, and e2e/ subdirectories [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

**Testing Framework**: pytest with pytest-asyncio for async testing [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Testing Standards**:
- Integration tests for API connectivity and authentication [Source: architecture/test-strategy.md]
- End-to-end tests for platform access verification [Source: architecture/test-strategy.md]
- No unit tests required for account setup process, but credential validation should be tested

**Testing Requirements for This Story**:

**API Integration Testing Details**:
- **Kaggle API Testing**: Validate API key with `/api/v1/datasets/list` endpoint, test notebook submission permissions, verify GPU quota retrieval via `/api/v1/kernels/list` with filter for GPU sessions
- **Google Colab Testing**: Test Google Drive API access for notebook storage, validate session creation limits, test GPU allocation requests through Colab runtime API
- **Paperspace API Testing**: Validate machine creation permissions via `/v1/machines/create` endpoint, test notebook environment setup, verify free tier resource limits through `/v1/users/current` endpoint
- **Weights & Biases API Testing**: Test project creation via `/api/v1/projects`, validate experiment logging with sample metrics, verify storage quota through `/api/v1/users/current` endpoint
- **Google Cloud Storage Testing**: Test bucket access with service account credentials, validate file upload/download operations, verify IAM permissions for checkpoint storage
- **Platform-Specific Error Scenarios**: Test rate limiting responses, invalid credential handling, quota exceeded scenarios, network timeout handling
- **Cross-Platform Integration**: Test credential rotation between platforms, validate failover scenarios when one platform is unavailable

**General Testing Requirements**:
- Verify environment variable loading and configuration
- Test error handling for invalid or expired credentials
- Validate platform quota and resource availability checks
- Test email notification delivery for system alerts

### Security Best Practices

**Credential Management**:
- **Environment Variable Isolation**: Use platform-specific prefixes (KAGGLE_, GCP_, WB_, PS_) to organize credentials and prevent conflicts
- **Credential Validation**: Implement credential format validation before storage (API key length, service account JSON structure)
- **Access Scoping**: Configure service accounts and API keys with minimal required permissions (principle of least privilege)
- **Credential Rotation**: Document rotation procedures and implement expiration monitoring for service accounts
- **Local Development Security**: Use `.env.local` for development credentials (gitignored), maintain `.env.example` template without sensitive values

**API Security**:
- **Rate Limiting Compliance**: Implement backoff strategies for API rate limits to avoid account suspension
- **HTTPS Only**: Enforce HTTPS for all API communications, validate SSL certificates
- **Request Signing**: Use proper authentication headers and request signing where supported by platforms
- **Error Handling**: Avoid exposing API keys or sensitive information in error logs or stack traces
- **Audit Logging**: Log all API authentication attempts (success/failure) for security monitoring

**Platform-Specific Security**:
- **Google Cloud**: Enable audit logs for service account usage, configure IAM conditions for IP/time-based restrictions
- **Kaggle**: Regularly review kernel activity and dataset access logs
- **Weights & Biases**: Configure team access controls, monitor experiment access patterns
- **Email Notifications**: Use app-specific passwords for email SMTP, configure TLS encryption

### Technical Constraints

- Python 3.12.7 as core language [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Secure credential storage using environment variables following established patterns [Source: architecture/security.md]
- Platform-specific API integration requirements per each service
- Free tier limitations must be documented and monitored [Source: epic requirements]
