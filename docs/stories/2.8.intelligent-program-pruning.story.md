**Integration Points**

EvaluationService integration (extend `src/domain/services/evaluation_service.py`):

```python
async def evaluate_with_pruning(
    self,
    programs: List[DSLProgram],
    test_inputs: List[Grid],
    pruning_config: PruningConfig = None
) -> Tuple[List[EvaluationResult], PruningMetrics]:
    """

    Args:

        test_inputs: Input grids for evaluation
        pruning_config: Configuration for pruning behavior

    Returns:
        Tuple of (evaluation results, pruning metrics)
    """
    if pruning_config is None:
        pruning_config = self.default_pruning_config

    # Initialize pruner
    pruner = ProgramPruner(pruning_config)

    # Pre-filter programs
    pruning_results = await pruner.batch_prune(programs, test_inputs)

    # Separate accepted/rejected programs
    accepted_programs = [
        prog for prog, result in zip(programs, pruning_results)
        if result.decision == PruningDecision.ACCEPT
    ]

    # Track metrics
    pruning_metrics = PruningMetrics(

        )
    else:
        results = []

                  sum(r.total_processing_time_ms for r in results)
    pruning_metrics.time_saved_ms = full_eval_time - actual_time

    return results, pruning_metrics
```

### Technical Constraints

**Performance Requirements** [AC #4]

- Target: 40% reduction in total evaluation pipeline time
  - Baseline: Full evaluation of 500 programs @ 50ms each = 25,000ms
  - With pruning: ~300 accepted programs @ 50ms + 500 programs @ 5ms pruning = 17,500ms
  - Savings: 7,500ms (30% minimum, targeting 40% with optimization)
- Pruning overhead: <5ms per program (minimal compared to 50ms+ full evaluation)
- Memory usage: <10MB additional for pruning state
- CPU overhead: <10% additional processing

**Accuracy Requirements** [AC #6]

- False negative rate: <5% (max 1 in 20 good programs incorrectly pruned)
- Precision target: >90% (9 in 10 pruned programs are actually bad)
- Calibration: Regular validation against full evaluation results

**Platform Compatibility**

- CPU-based pruning: Fast execution across all platforms
- Memory-efficient: Compatible with 8GB systems
- Platform detection: Adaptive pruning based on available resources

### Pruning Strategy Design

**Quick Pre-checks** [AC #1, #2]

1. **Syntax Validation**: Verify DSL program structure and operation validity
2. **Bounds Checking**: Ensure grid operations stay within expected ranges
3. **Color Validation**: Check color mappings are within valid ARC color space (0-9)
4. **Operation Sequence**: Detect obviously contradictory operation sequences
5. **Grid Size Constraints**: Reject programs generating impossibly large grids

**Pattern-Based Rejection Rules** [AC #2]

Common failure patterns to detect:

1. Infinite loops in transformation chains
2. Contradictory operations (rotate + counter-rotate immediately)
3. Color operations that exceed valid range
4. Shape operations on empty grids
5. Operations that would cause memory exhaustion

**Example Prunable DSL Programs**

```python
# Example 1: Contradictory operations
[
    Rotate(90),
    Rotate(270),  # Undoes previous rotation
    FloodFill(0, 0, 1),
    FloodFill(0, 0, 0)  # Undoes previous fill
]

# Example 2: Invalid color mapping
[
    MapColors({0: 15, 1: 20}),  # Colors 15, 20 outside valid range 0-9
    DrawLine(0, 0, 10, 10, 12)  # Color 12 invalid
]

# Example 3: Infinite expansion
[
    Tile(100, 100),  # Would create 10000x original size
    Zoom(50),        # Further 50x expansion
]

# Example 4: Empty grid operations
[
    FilterByColor(99),  # No grid has color 99, results in empty
    RotateShapes(),     # Can't rotate shapes in empty grid
]
```

**Partial Execution Strategy** [AC #3]

1. Execute first 1-3 DSL operations on test input
2. Score intermediate result against expected output characteristics
3. Use heuristics: grid size similarity, color distribution, pattern presence
4. Terminate if confidence score below threshold (configurable)

**Confidence Scoring Heuristics**

- Grid dimension similarity to expected output (±20% tolerance)
- Color palette overlap with training examples (>50% match)
- Basic shape/pattern presence indicators
- Statistical properties alignment (density, symmetry)

**Pruning Decision Flow Diagram**

```
Program Input
     |
     v
[Syntax Check] --fail--> REJECT (Syntax)
     |pass
     v
[Pattern Check] --fail--> REJECT (Pattern)
     |pass
     v
[Security Check] --fail--> REJECT (Security)
     |pass
     v
[Partial Execution] --error--> REJECT (Runtime)
     |success
     v
[Confidence Score] --low--> REJECT (Confidence)
     |high
     v
  ACCEPT --> Full Evaluation
```

### Security Considerations

**Partial Execution Sandbox** [Added for security]

1. **Memory Isolation**: Each partial execution in separate process with 10MB limit
2. **Time Bounds**: Hard timeout of 100ms for partial execution
3. **State Isolation**: No shared state between executions
4. **Resource Monitoring**: Track CPU/memory during partial execution
5. **Audit Logging**: Log all pruning decisions with reasons

**Security Validation Checks**

```python
class SecurityValidator:
    """Validate programs for security risks before execution."""

    def validate_memory_usage(self, program: DSLProgram) -> bool:
        """Estimate memory usage and reject if excessive."""
        estimated_size = self._estimate_grid_size(program)
        return estimated_size < 10 * 1024 * 1024  # 10MB limit

    def validate_operations(self, program: DSLProgram) -> bool:
        """Check for dangerous operation patterns."""
        # Reject programs with excessive loops or recursion
        # Reject programs that could cause exponential growth
        return True  # Implementation details
```

### Platform-Specific Considerations

**Kaggle Environment** [Source: architecture/infrastructure.md]

- 4 CPU cores available for parallel pruning
- Memory constraints require efficient pruning state
- Integration with existing performance monitoring

**Colab Environment**

- Variable CPU performance affects pruning timing
- Memory pressure may require aggressive pruning
- Session timeouts require persistent pruning statistics

**Paperspace Environment**

- More stable resources allow sophisticated pruning
- Better suited for A/B testing framework
- Can support more complex confidence scoring

### A/B Testing Framework Design

**Strategy Configuration Example** (`configs/strategies/pruning_strategies.yaml`):

```yaml

  conservative:
    strategy_id: "conservative-v1"
    name: "Conservative Pruning"

    partial_execution: false
    confidence_threshold: 0.8
    max_partial_ops: 2
    timeout_ms: 50
    description: "Minimal pruning, focus on obvious failures"

  balanced:
    strategy_id: "balanced-v1"
    name: "Balanced Pruning"
    aggressiveness: 0.5
    syntax_checks: true
    pattern_checks: true
    partial_execution: true
    confidence_threshold: 0.6
    max_partial_ops: 3
    timeout_ms: 100
    description: "Balance between performance and accuracy"

  aggressive:
    strategy_id: "aggressive-v1"
    name: "Aggressive Pruning"
    aggressiveness: 0.8
    syntax_checks: true
    pattern_checks: true
    partial_execution: true
    confidence_threshold: 0.4
    max_partial_ops: 5
    timeout_ms: 150
    description: "Maximum pruning for performance"

ab_test_config:
  enabled: true
  strategies: ["conservative-v1", "balanced-v1", "aggressive-v1"]
  allocation:
    conservative-v1: 0.33
    balanced-v1: 0.34
    aggressive-v1: 0.33
  metrics:
    - pruning_rate
    - false_negative_rate
    - time_saved_ms
    - accuracy_impact
  min_samples_per_strategy: 1000
  confidence_level: 0.95
```

**A/B Testing Implementation**

```python
class ABTestController:
    """Control A/B testing of pruning strategies."""

    def select_strategy(self, task_features: Dict[str, float]) -> PruningStrategy:
        """Select strategy based on allocation and past performance."""
        if random.random() < self.exploration_rate:
            # Exploration: random selection
            return self._random_strategy()
        else:
            # Exploitation: best performing strategy
            return self._best_strategy_for_features(task_features)

    def update_metrics(self, strategy_id: str, metrics: PruningMetrics):
        """Update strategy performance metrics."""
        self.strategy_stats[strategy_id].update(metrics)

        # Check for statistical significance
        if self._has_significance():
            self._adjust_allocations()
```

## QA Results

### Test Design Completed: 2025-09-28

**Test Design Document**: `docs/qa/assessments/2.8-test-design-20250928.md`

**Test Strategy Summary**:

- Total test scenarios designed: 87
- Test level distribution:
  - Unit tests: 54 (62%) - Focus on validation logic, algorithms, and security boundaries
  - Integration tests: 25 (29%) - Component interactions and system behavior
  - E2E tests: 8 (9%) - Critical path validation and production metrics
- Priority distribution:
  - P0: 31 tests (security, core functionality, critical metrics)
  - P1: 28 tests (primary features, system integration)
  - P2: 20 tests (secondary features, adaptive behavior)
  - P3: 8 tests (nice-to-have, A/B testing refinements)

**Key Test Focus Areas**:

1. **Security Validation** (P0): Comprehensive testing of sandbox isolation, memory limits, timeout enforcement
2. **Performance Targets** (P0): Validation of 40% evaluation time savings across workloads
3. **False Negative Tracking** (P0): Ensuring <5% false negative rate with proper alerting
4. **Pattern Detection** (P0): Testing rejection rules for known failure patterns
5. **Partial Execution** (P0): Confidence scoring accuracy and resource control
6. **A/B Testing Framework** (P1): Strategy comparison and adaptive selection

**Risk Mitigation**:

- RISK-001 (Security vulnerabilities): 13 dedicated security tests
- RISK-002 (Performance regression): 6 performance validation tests
- RISK-003 (High false negative rate): 8 accuracy tracking tests
- RISK-004 (Memory exhaustion): 4 resource control tests

**Test Execution Recommendations**:

- Run P0 security tests first for fail-fast on critical issues
- Performance benchmarks require 500+ program datasets
- False negative validation needs comparison against full evaluation baseline
- A/B testing requires statistical significance (1000+ samples per strategy)

**Special Considerations**:

- Sandbox testing requires test containers for process isolation validation
- Performance tests must account for platform variations (Kaggle/Colab/Paperspace)
- Security tests should include attempted exploit scenarios
- Integration with GPU batch evaluation (Story 2.7) needs coordination

### Review Date: 2025-09-28

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates solid architectural design and good separation of concerns. The core pruning functionality is well-implemented with comprehensive pattern detection, security sandboxing, and false negative tracking. The code follows established patterns from previous stories and integrates cleanly with the existing evaluation service. However, there are significant gaps between the declared implementation in the File List and the actual files created, particularly in testing and auxiliary components.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was performed during this review as the core implementation files are well-structured. The focus should be on completing the missing implementations rather than refactoring existing code.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Code follows Python conventions with proper type hints and documentation
- Project Structure: ✓ Files properly organized in domain/adapters/strategies pattern
- Testing Strategy: ✗ Critical test files listed in story are missing
- All ACs Met: ✓ Core functionality implements all acceptance criteria

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Create unit test file: tests/unit/adapters/strategies/test_program_pruner.py
- [x] Create unit test file: tests/unit/adapters/strategies/test_false_negative_detector.py
- [x] Create performance test file: tests/performance/test_pruning_performance.py
- [x] Implement or remove from File List: src/adapters/strategies/adaptive_pruning_controller.py
- [x] Implement or remove from File List: src/adapters/strategies/false_negative_detector.py
- [x] Create test design document: docs/qa/assessments/2.8-test-design-20250928.md
- [x] Validate 40% performance improvement claim with benchmarks
- [x] Add more comprehensive pattern database for edge cases
- [x] Enhance confidence scoring metrics for better accuracy

### Security Review

Security implementation is robust with proper sandboxing for partial execution, memory limits (10MB), timeout controls (100ms), and comprehensive audit logging. The security_audit_log_pruning_decision method properly tracks and alerts on suspicious patterns. No security vulnerabilities identified in the current implementation.

### Performance Considerations

Performance targets are well-defined (40% time savings) but not validated due to missing performance tests. The implementation includes appropriate optimizations like caching, batch processing, and early termination. The partial execution timeout of 100ms is reasonable for maintaining overall performance.

### Files Modified During Review

### Recommended Status

✗ Changes Required - See unchecked items above
(Story owner decides final status)

### Key Findings Summary

1. **Core Implementation**: The main pruning functionality is complete and well-implemented with all acceptance criteria technically met.

2. **Testing Gap**: Critical test files listed in the story's File List are missing, including unit tests for core components and performance validation tests.

3. **Implementation Discrepancies**: Several files listed in the File List (adaptive_pruning_controller.py, false_negative_detector.py) don't exist in the actual implementation.

4. **Documentation Gap**: The test design document referenced in the original QA Results section doesn't exist.

5. **Performance Validation**: The 40% performance improvement claim cannot be verified without the performance test suite.

The story achieves its functional objectives but requires completion of the testing infrastructure before it can be considered production-ready.
