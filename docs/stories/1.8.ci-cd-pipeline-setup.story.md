# Story 1.8: CI/CD Pipeline Setup

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** automated testing and deployment pipelines,
**so that** code quality is maintained and deployments are reliable.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. GitHub Actions workflow for Python 3.12 testing
2. Automated linting (ruff) and type checking (mypy)
3. Unit test execution on every PR
4. Security scanning with safety/bandit
5. Docker image build and registry push
6. Platform deployment scripts integration
7. Branch protection rules configured
8. Deployment status notifications

## Tasks / Subtasks

**Note**: Tasks 1-3 are prerequisites for Task 4. Task 4 should only begin after Tasks 1-3 are completed and tested.

- [ ] Task 1 (AC: 1, 2, 3) - Set up GitHub Actions workflow for Python testing
  - [ ] Subtask 1.1 - Create workflow file .github/workflows/ci.yml
  - [ ] Subtask 1.2 - Configure Python 3.12.7 environment in workflow
  - [ ] Subtask 1.3 - Add ruff linting step to workflow (latest stable version)
  - [ ] Subtask 1.4 - Add mypy type checking step to workflow (latest stable version)
  - [ ] Subtask 1.5 - Add pytest unit test execution step to workflow
- [ ] Task 2 (AC: 4) - Integrate security scanning tools
  - [ ] Subtask 2.1 - Add safety dependency scanning to workflow (latest stable version)
  - [ ] Subtask 2.2 - Add bandit security scanning to workflow (latest stable version)
  - [ ] Subtask 2.3 - Configure security scanning results reporting in pyproject.toml
- [ ] Task 3 (AC: 5) - Implement Docker image build and push
  - [ ] Subtask 3.1 - Create Dockerfile in deployment/docker/Dockerfile
  - [ ] Subtask 3.2 - Add Docker build step to workflow
  - [ ] Subtask 3.3 - Configure Docker registry push with secure credentials management
- [ ] Task 4 (AC: 6, 7, 8) - Integrate deployment scripts and configure notifications (Depends on Tasks 1-3)
  - [ ] Subtask 4.1 - Add platform deployment script execution to workflow
  - [ ] Subtask 4.2 - Configure branch protection rules: require PR reviews, require status checks, restrict direct pushes to main
  - [ ] Subtask 4.3 - Set up deployment status notifications (email to project team, GitHub status checks)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

- Story 1.7 successfully implemented authentication framework with JWT tokens
- Key learnings included JWT utility functions, FastAPI middleware, and environment variable management
- Security considerations were implemented as part of the overall system design

### Data Models

- No specific data models required for CI/CD pipeline setup [Source: architecture/data-models.md]

### API Specifications

- No specific API endpoints need to be implemented for this story [Source: architecture/rest-api-specification.md]

### Component Specifications

- GitHub Actions workflows in .github/workflows/ [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- Dockerfile in deployment/docker/ [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- Platform deployment scripts in scripts/platform_deploy/ [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

### File Locations

- GitHub Actions workflow file: .github/workflows/ci.yml [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- Dockerfile: deployment/docker/Dockerfile [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- Security scanning configuration: pyproject.toml [tool.bandit] and [tool.safety] sections [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- Platform deployment scripts: scripts/platform_deploy/kaggle_setup.py, colab_setup.py, paperspace_setup.py [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- Docker compose file: deployment/docker/docker-compose.yaml [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

### Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for critical paths [Source: architecture/test-strategy.md]
- No specific test cases required for CI/CD pipeline setup, but workflow should include test execution

### Testing

**Test File Locations**: tests/ directory with unit/, integration/, and e2e/ subdirectories [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

**Testing Framework**: pytest with pytest-asyncio for async testing [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Testing Standards**:
- All tests must pass before merge to main branch
- Minimum 70% code coverage for unit tests (following testing pyramid: 70% unit, 25% integration, 5% e2e) [Source: architecture/test-strategy.md]
- Integration tests for API endpoints and database interactions
- Workflow validation tests to ensure CI/CD pipeline configuration is correct

**Testing Requirements for This Story**:
- Test that GitHub Actions workflow executes successfully
- Verify all linting and type checking steps pass
- Validate Docker image builds successfully
- Test security scanning tools detect known vulnerabilities in test cases
- Verify branch protection rules prevent unauthorized merges

### Technical Constraints

- Python 3.12.7 as core language [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD platform [Source: architecture/infrastructure.md]
- Docker for containerization [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
