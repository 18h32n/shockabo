## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

- Story 1.4 successfully implemented TTT baseline with 1B model achieving 40%+ accuracy
- Key learnings included LoRA adaptation working effectively and memory usage staying under 10GB
- MIT TTT codebase was successfully forked and adapted
- LoRA rank 32 worked well for 1B model, scaling to rank 64 for 8B maintains similar efficiency ratios
- Memory optimization techniques from 1B implementation should be preserved and scaled proportionally
- Training checkpoint strategy proved effective and should be enhanced with more frequent saves
