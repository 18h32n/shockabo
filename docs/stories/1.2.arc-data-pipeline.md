- Efficient sparse matrix representation required for large grids (AC: 4)

**Technology Stack**: [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#data-processing]

### Coding Standards

**Data Processing Standards**: [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#python-style-guide]

- Use Black formatter with line length 100
- Use ruff for linting and import sorting
- Type hints required for all function signatures
- Use dataclasses for data structures
- Document performance considerations in docstrings

**Technical Debt Management**: [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#technical-debt-management]

- Use format: `# TODO: TECH-DEBT-[LEVEL] - [Description] - [Author] - [Date]`
- Mark experimental optimizations with clear TODO markers
- All code must pass ruff linting and mypy type checking

### Testing Requirements

**Testing Framework**: [Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy.md#unit-testing]

- Use pytest for all testing with 70% unit, 25% integration, 5% E2E distribution
- Test files location: `tests/unit/adapters/repositories/` and `tests/unit/utils/`
- Performance tests required for memory usage and load time validation

**Specific Testing Requirements for This Story**:

- Unit tests for data loading performance (must achieve < 10 seconds for 1000 tasks)
- Unit tests for caching mechanisms and cache invalidation
- Unit tests for data augmentation operations (rotation, flips)
- Integration tests for full pipeline from raw data to processed batches
- Memory usage tests to validate < 4GB requirement
- Data integrity tests to ensure augmentations preserve task semantics

### Technical Constraints

- Python 3.12.7 exact version requirement
- Memory efficiency critical due to platform GPU constraints
- Must work across Kaggle, Colab, and local environments
- Performance requirements driven by competition time constraints
- Integration with existing infrastructure components required

### Implementation Guidelines for Enhanced Features

**Cache Strategy Implementation**:
- Configure default cache size limit of 2GB to balance performance with storage constraints
- Implement LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction policy for automatic cleanup
- Add cache hit/miss ratio monitoring for performance optimization
- Include cache size tracking with alerts when approaching limits

**Data Augmentation Validation**:
- Semantic preservation tests should verify that augmented grids maintain logical relationships
- Color mapping validation: ensure augmentation doesn't change color-to-meaning mappings
- Pattern relationship checks: verify spatial patterns remain consistent after transformations
- Implement before/after grid comparison utilities for debugging augmentation issues

**Batch Strategy Examples**:
- Task-based batching strategies:
  * Group by difficulty_level (easy/medium/hard) for progressive training
  * Group by family_id for related task processing
  * Group by grid dimensions for consistent memory usage
- Example-based batching strategies:
  * Group by input grid size (small: <10x10, medium: 10x20, large: >20x20)
  * Group by number of examples per task for consistent processing times
  * Group by complexity metrics (number of colors, unique patterns)

## Testing
