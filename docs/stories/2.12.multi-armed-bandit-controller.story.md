**Data Models** [Source: src/domain/models.py - VERIFIED EXISTS]

Existing models in codebase:

- `ARCTask` - Core task representation (src/domain/models.py:10-93)
- `StrategyType` - Enum with TEST_TIME_TRAINING, PROGRAM_SYNTHESIS, EVOLUTION, IMITATION_LEARNING, HYBRID (src/domain/models.py:95-101)

- `StrategyOutput` - Standardized output with confidence_score, resource_usage (src/domain/models.py:136-286)

New models to add to `src/adapters/strategies/bandit_controller.py` in Task 1:

```python
@dataclass
class GenerationStrategy:
    """Represents a generation strategy for bandit selection."""
    strategy_id: str  # e.g., "hybrid_init", "pure_llm", "dsl_based", "mutation_heavy"
    success_count: int = 0
    failure_count: int = 0
    total_reward: float = 0.0
    selection_count: int = 0

@dataclass
class BanditState:
    """Thompson Sampling state for all strategies."""
    strategies: Dict[str, GenerationStrategy]
    alpha_prior: float = 1.0  # Success prior
    beta_prior: float = 1.0   # Failure prior
    warmup_selections: int = 50
```

**Bandit Controller Interface** [Source: Multi-Armed Bandit theory, Epic 2 PRD]

Location: `src/adapters/strategies/bandit_controller.py` (TO BE CREATED in Task 1)

Required interface to create:

```python
from typing import Dict, List, Optional
import numpy as np

class BanditController:
    def __init__(self,
                 strategies: List[str],
                 alpha_prior: float = 1.0,
                 beta_prior: float = 1.0,
                 warmup_selections: int = 50):
        """Initialize Thompson Sampling controller."""
        pass

    def select_strategy(self, task_features: Optional[Dict[str, float]] = None) -> str:
        """Select best strategy using Thompson Sampling."""
        pass

    def update_reward(self, strategy_id: str, reward: float, cost: float = 0.0) -> None:
        """Update strategy statistics with reward signal."""
        pass

    def get_strategy_stats(self) -> Dict[str, Dict[str, float]]:
        """Get current statistics for all strategies."""
        pass
```

**Reward Signal Design** [Source: Epic 2 PRD, Story 2.5 requirements]

Primary reward: Fitness improvement (0.0-1.0 normalized)

- Perfect solution: reward = 1.0
- Partial match: reward = (matching_pixels / total_pixels)
- No match: reward = 0.0
- Failure: reward = -0.5

Cost-adjusted reward:

- reward_final = fitness / (1 + cost_weight \* cost_normalized)
- cost_normalized = (cost - min_cost) / (max_cost - min_cost)
- cost_weight configurable (default 0.3)

**Task Feature Extraction** [Source: ARC task structure, contextual bandit theory]

Feature categories for contextual bandits:

Grid features:

- Grid size: height, width, area (normalized 0-1)
- Aspect ratio: width / height

Color features:

- Unique colors: count of distinct colors (0-10)
- Color distribution: entropy of color frequency
- Dominant color: most frequent color

Pattern features:

- Edge density: count of color transitions / total cells
- Symmetry: horizontal, vertical, rotational (binary flags)
- Object count: connected components analysis

Expected feature vector size: ~10-15 features per task

**Generation Strategies for Bandit Selection** [Source: Story 2.5, 2.2 implementations]

Available strategies to allocate (from existing codebase):

1. **Hybrid Initialization** (src/adapters/strategies/hybrid_initialization.py)

   - LLM-guided + random programs
   - Cost: High (API calls)
   - Expected success: 60-70%

2. **Pure LLM Generation** (src/adapters/strategies/program_synthesis.py)

   - GPT-5/Gemini direct generation
   - Cost: Very High
   - Expected success: 70%+

3. **DSL-Based Mutation** (src/adapters/strategies/genetic_operators.py)

   - Mutation operators on existing programs
   - Cost: Low (no API)
   - Expected success: 40-50%

4. **Crossover-Focused** (src/adapters/strategies/genetic_operators.py)

   - Crossover of high-fitness programs
   - Cost: Low (no API)
   - Expected success: 35-45%

5. **Adaptive Mutation** (src/adapters/strategies/adaptive_evolution.py)
   - Fitness-based mutation rate adaptation
   - Cost: Low (no API)
   - Expected success: 45-55%

**Hexagonal Architecture Integration** [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md]

The BanditController is an adapter-layer component that:

- Does NOT require a domain port interface (internal strategy optimization)
- Integrates with EvolutionEngine (existing adapter)
- Uses RewardTracker and TaskFeatureExtractor (new adapters)
- Leverages existing MetricsCollector for monitoring
- Leverages existing StructuredLogger for decision traces

**Thompson Sampling Algorithm** [Source: Bandit theory, Chapelle & Li 2011]

Algorithm overview:

1. For each generation, sample from posterior distributions:
   - For strategy i: theta_i ~ Beta(alpha_i, beta_i)
   - alpha_i = alpha_prior + success_count
   - beta_i = beta_prior + failure_count
2. Select strategy with highest sampled theta
3. Execute strategy and observe reward
4. Update strategy statistics:
   - If reward > 0.5: increment success_count
   - If reward <= 0.5: increment failure_count
   - Add reward to total_reward

Warm-up period:

- First 50 selections per strategy: uniform random selection
- Ensures each strategy gets fair initial exploration

**Contextual Bandit Extension** [Source: Li et al. 2010 - LinUCB, contextual bandits]

Contextual selection approach:

1. Group tasks by feature similarity (k-means clustering, k=5)
2. Track strategy performance per cluster
3. Select strategy based on current task's cluster membership
4. Fallback to global Thompson Sampling if cluster too small (<10 tasks)

**Performance Requirements**

Selection latency (AC #5):

- Strategy selection: <10ms per selection
- Feature extraction: <50ms per task
- Reward update: <5ms per update

Performance improvement (AC #7):

- 20%+ improvement in one of:
  - Average fitness score
  - Convergence speed (generations to solution)
  - Cost efficiency (fitness per dollar)
- Measured over 100-task benchmark
- Statistical significance: p-value < 0.05

### Security Considerations

**Input Validation:**

- Validate task features are in expected ranges (prevent adversarial inputs)
- Sanitize strategy IDs to prevent injection attacks
- Validate reward values are in valid range (handle NaN/Inf)

**Failure Handling:**

- Circuit breaker prevents infinite failure loops
- Fallback to uniform allocation if all strategies fail
- Maximum failure penalty limited to prevent negative spiral

**Resource Management:**

- Limit bandit state size (max 1000 strategies)
- Bound history size for reward tracking (max 10000 records)
- Prevent memory exhaustion from feature extraction

## Testing

**Test Framework**: pytest with pytest-asyncio [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Test Coverage Requirements**:

- Integration tests for evolution pipeline with bandit
- Performance tests validating 20%+ improvement
- Failure scenario tests (timeout, errors, convergence failure)

**Assertion Strategy**:

- Validate strategy selection respects Beta distribution properties
