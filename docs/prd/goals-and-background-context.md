# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- **Achieve 85% accuracy on ARC-AGI-2 private evaluation dataset** - Surpass current AI performance (53%) and approach human-level (73-77%)
- **Develop a Multi-Strategy Reasoning System (MSRS)** - Combine program synthesis, evolutionary discovery, imitation learning, and hybrid neural-symbolic approaches
- **Win the ARC Prize 2025 competition** - Secure the $825,000+ prize by November 3, 2025
- **Stay within $0.42 computational budget per task** - Optimize efficiency while maintaining accuracy
- **Create interpretable reasoning traces** - Enable debugging and understanding of AI decision-making
- **Build modular, open-source solution** - Allow integration with other approaches and contribute to AGI research
- **Establish adaptive intelligence** - System learns which strategy works best for different puzzle types
- **Demonstrate genuine reasoning beyond pattern matching** - Bridge the 20-24 point gap between current AI and human performance

## Background Context

The ARC Prize 2025 project addresses a fundamental limitation in current AI systems: the inability to perform genuine reasoning on novel tasks. While modern AI excels at pattern matching within training distributions, it fails catastrophically when faced with abstract reasoning challenges that humans find trivial. The ARC-AGI benchmark exposes this gap starkly - despite transformers achieving superhuman performance on many benchmarks, they only reach 53% accuracy on ARC tasks compared to 73-77% for average humans.

This project proposes a Multi-Strategy Reasoning System that mirrors human problem-solving by trying different mental strategies until one succeeds. By combining program synthesis, evolutionary discovery, imitation learning from human traces, and hybrid neural-symbolic approaches, we aim to create an AI system that can discover and apply abstract transformation rules from minimal examples. Success would represent a breakthrough toward genuine artificial general intelligence - a system demonstrating fluid reasoning and skill acquisition beyond memorized knowledge.
