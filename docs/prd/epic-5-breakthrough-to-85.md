# Epic 5: Breakthrough to 85%

Goal: Implement advanced techniques including hierarchical meta-learning, adversarial training, and novel architectures to bridge the gap from 65% to 85% accuracy. This epic contains our most innovative and risky approaches.

## Innovation Tournament: Breakthrough Techniques

**Winner Combination**:
1. **Hierarchical Meta-Learning** (8% gain)
2. **Self-Supervised Pre-training** on synthetic tasks (6% gain)
3. **Ensemble Distillation** into single model (4% gain)
4. **Test-Time Augmentation voting** (3% gain)
Total: 21% theoretical gain (15% expected in practice)

## Story 5.1: Hierarchical Meta-Learning

As a developer,
I want multi-level adaptation,
so that the system learns at task, pattern, and family levels.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: Three-level learning hierarchy implemented
2: Task-family clustering with 85%+ accuracy
3: Family-specific meta-parameters
4: Cross-family knowledge transfer
5: 8%+ accuracy gain from hierarchy
6: Interpretable family characteristics
7: Fast adaptation within families

**Critique & Refinement**: Consider adding a fourth level for "super-families" that capture meta-patterns across different task types, potentially adding 2-3% more accuracy.

## Story 5.2: Self-Supervised Pre-training

As a developer,
I want to pre-train on millions of synthetic tasks,
so that models have stronger priors for ARC patterns.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: Generate 1M+ synthetic ARC-like tasks
2: Curriculum learning from simple to complex
3: Self-supervised objectives (reconstruction, prediction)
4: Transfer learning evaluation
5: 6%+ accuracy gain from pre-training
6: Efficient synthetic task generation
7: Quality validation of synthetic tasks

## Story 5.3: Neural Program Synthesis Breakthrough

As a developer,
I want neural-guided program synthesis,
so that we can discover complex transformation rules.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: Neural network predicting DSL operations
2: Beam search with neural guidance
3: Hierarchical program construction
4: 70%+ synthesis success rate
5: Handle multi-step transformations
6: 10%+ accuracy gain over evolution
7: Explainable program generation

## Story 5.4: Ensemble Distillation

As a developer,
I want to distill ensemble knowledge into a single model,
so that we can achieve ensemble accuracy with single-model speed.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: Knowledge distillation framework
2: Maintain 95% of ensemble accuracy
3: 5x faster inference than full ensemble
4: Selective distillation for different task types
5: Continuous distillation during training
6: Interpretability preservation
7: 4%+ accuracy gain from distillation

## Story 5.5: Test-Time Augmentation System

As a developer,
I want comprehensive test-time augmentation,
so that we can boost accuracy through voting.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: 8 augmentation types (rotation, reflection, color permutation)
2: Augmentation selection based on task type
3: Efficient batch processing of augmentations
4: Voting mechanism with confidence weighting
5: 3%+ accuracy gain from augmentation
6: Augmentation interpretability
7: Fast augmentation pipeline (<2s overhead)

## Story 5.6: Final Push Optimization

As a developer,
I want to apply all optimizations in 5 passes,
so that we maximize our chance of reaching 85%.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: Pass 1: Algorithm correctness validation
2: Pass 2: Memory efficiency optimization
3: Pass 3: Inference speed improvements
4: Pass 4: Accuracy fine-tuning
5: Pass 5: Cost optimization
6: Achieve 85%+ accuracy target
7: Maintain all optimizations in production

## Story 5.7: Breakthrough Integration & Validation

As a developer,
I want to systematically integrate all breakthroughs,
so that we achieve maximum combined benefit.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: Systematic ablation studies
2: Optimal combination identification
3: Integration order optimization
4: Synergy effect measurement
5: Final accuracy validation
6: Comprehensive documentation
7: 85%+ accuracy achieved
