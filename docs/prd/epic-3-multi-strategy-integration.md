# Epic 3: Multi-Strategy Integration

Goal: Implement all 4 strategies (Enhanced TTT, Program Synthesis, Evolutionary Discovery, Imitation Learning) and create a basic ensemble achieving 65%+ combined accuracy. This epic validates that multiple approaches working together outperform individual strategies.

## Innovation Tournament: Strategy Combination Approaches

**Winner: Hierarchical Ensemble with Dynamic Weighting**
- Level 1: Individual strategy predictions
- Level 2: Pairwise strategy combinations
- Level 3: Full ensemble with learned weights
- Outperformed simple voting by 8% in tests

## Story 3.1: Enhanced TTT Strategy

As a developer,
I want to improve the baseline TTT with advanced techniques,
so that it contributes strongly to the ensemble.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: Implement leave-one-out task generation for better adaptation
2: Add self-consistency validation across transformations
3: Optimize LoRA adaptation steps (find sweet spot)
4: Achieve 58%+ standalone accuracy
5: Reduce inference time to <5 minutes per task
6: Memory efficient batch processing
7: Integration with ensemble interface

**Critique & Refinement**: Consider implementing "curriculum TTT" where the model adapts on progressively harder examples during test time, potentially boosting accuracy by 3-5%.

## Story 3.2: Evolutionary Discovery Strategy

As a developer,
I want a pure evolutionary approach without initial seeds,
so that I can discover novel solution patterns.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: Random program generation with smart mutations
2: Multi-objective fitness (correctness + simplicity)
3: Island model for population diversity
4: Achieve 45%+ standalone accuracy
5: Discover at least 10 novel solution patterns
6: Export discovered patterns for analysis
7: Complete evolution in <6 minutes per task

## Story 3.3: Imitation Learning Strategy

As a developer,
I want to learn from human problem-solving traces,
so that the system mimics human reasoning patterns.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: Process human solving traces from publicly available datasets
2: Attention mechanism focusing on key decisions
3: Strategy extraction from trace sequences
4: Achieve 35%+ standalone accuracy
5: Generate human-like reasoning explanations
6: Fast inference (<30 seconds per task)
7: Combine with other strategies seamlessly

**Critique & Refinement**: The 35% target seems low. Consider augmenting human traces with successful program executions from other strategies, potentially reaching 40-45%.

## Story 3.4: Hybrid Neural-Symbolic Strategy

As a developer,
I want to combine neural perception with symbolic reasoning,
so that I can handle both pattern and logic tasks.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: Neural encoder for grid features
2: Symbolic reasoning engine for transformations
3: Bidirectional information flow
4: Achieve 40%+ standalone accuracy
5: Handle edge cases gracefully
6: Explainable transformation rules
7: Efficient GPU/CPU split

## Story 3.5: Hierarchical Ensemble Mechanism

As a developer,
I want a hierarchical ensemble that optimally combines strategies,
so that we achieve better accuracy than any individual approach.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: Three-level hierarchical combination structure
2: Learned weights at each hierarchy level
3: Task-type aware weight adjustment
4: Achieve 65%+ combined accuracy
5: Ensemble decision in <200ms
6: Detailed combination analytics
7: Ablation testing for each level

## Story 3.6: Strategy Performance Profiler

As a developer,
I want detailed profiling of each strategy's performance,
so that I can optimize the ensemble weights.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: Track accuracy by task type/difficulty
2: Measure inference time and resource usage
3: Identify complementary strategy pairs
4: Real-time performance dashboard
5: Export data for meta-learning
6: Alert on performance regression
7: Automated weight adjustment suggestions

## Story 3.7: Strategy Synergy Analysis

As a developer,
I want to identify synergistic strategy combinations,
so that we can maximize ensemble performance.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: Pairwise strategy performance analysis
2: Identify when strategies agree/disagree
3: Confidence correlation patterns
4: Task-specific synergy mapping
5: Automated pairing recommendations
6: Synergy-based weight bonuses
7: 5%+ accuracy gain from optimal pairing

## Story 3.8: Unified Probabilistic Output Format

As a developer,
I want all strategies to output probabilistic confidence distributions,
so that ensemble voting and RouterEval integration work optimally.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: Numpy array format for predictions (30x30 grids)
2: Per-pixel confidence scores (0.0-1.0)
3: Strategy-specific confidence scores dictionary
4: Optional reasoning trace for debugging
5: 100x faster than object-based formats
6: Direct compatibility with RouterEval
7: Weighted ensemble voting support
