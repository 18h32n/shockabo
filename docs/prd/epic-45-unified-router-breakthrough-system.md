# Epic 4/5: Unified Router & Breakthrough System

Goal: Create an intelligent RouterEval-based system that dynamically selects strategies while implementing breakthrough techniques to achieve 85% accuracy. This merged epic combines meta-learning, routing, and advanced techniques in a unified approach.

## Innovation Tournament: Meta-Learning Architectures

**Winner: Ensemble of Routers (User Selection)**
- Multiple routing strategies: MLP + Rule-based + Transformer + Random Forest
- Each router votes, weighted by past performance history
- 5-10% more accurate than single transformer, with 3-4x slower inference
- Robust against single-point-of-failure scenarios

## Story 4.1: Task Feature Extractor

As a developer,
I want to extract rich features from ARC tasks,
so that I can make informed strategy selections.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: Extract 50+ meaningful task features
2: Include color statistics, symmetry measures, pattern complexity
3: Fast feature extraction (<20ms per task)
4: Features correlate with strategy performance
5: Visualization of feature space
6: Handle edge cases robustly
7: Export features for analysis

**Critique & Refinement**: Static features may miss subtle patterns. Consider implementing a learned feature extractor that discovers task-relevant features during training.

## Story 4.2: Transformer-based Strategy Router

As a developer,
I want a transformer model that routes tasks to strategies,
so that we maximize accuracy while minimizing cost.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: Transformer architecture with task embeddings
2: Multi-head attention over task features
3: Predict success probability per strategy
4: Cost-aware routing decisions
5: 85%+ routing accuracy
6: Interpretable attention patterns
7: Fine-tuning on competition data

## Story 4.3: Budget-Aware Optimization

As a developer,
I want dynamic resource allocation,
so that we stay within $0.42 per task reliably.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: Real-time cost tracking for all operations
2: Dynamic strategy timeout adjustment
3: Graceful degradation when approaching limit
4: Achieve <$0.40 average cost per task
5: Detailed cost breakdown reporting
6: Predictive budget warnings
7: Emergency fallback to cheapest strategy

## Story 4.4: Online Learning System

As a developer,
I want continuous learning from results,
so that the system improves during competition.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: Online weight updates with safety bounds
2: Catastrophic forgetting prevention
3: A/B testing for significant changes
4: Rollback mechanism for bad updates
5: Learning rate scheduling
6: Performance tracking dashboard
7: 3-5% improvement during competition

## Story 4.5: Performance Optimization Pipeline

As a developer,
I want systematic performance optimization,
so that inference speed improves without accuracy loss.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: Profile all bottlenecks across strategies
2: Implement top 10 optimizations
3: Achieve 30% overall speedup
4: Maintain test coverage during optimization
5: Automated performance regression tests

7: Documentation of all optimizations

## Story 4.6: Failure Analysis System

As a developer,
I want comprehensive failure analysis,
so that I can identify improvement opportunities.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: Categorize all failure modes
2: Pattern detection in failures
3: Automated error reports with context
4: Suggest targeted improvements
5: Track failure trends over time
6: Export data for Epic 5 breakthrough work
7: 90%+ failure categorization accuracy

## Story 4.7: Cost-Performance Trade-off Optimizer

As a developer,
I want to optimize the cost-performance trade-off,
so that we maximize accuracy within budget constraints.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: Pareto frontier visualization
2: Automated trade-off recommendations
3: Task-specific budget allocation
4: Historical performance analysis
