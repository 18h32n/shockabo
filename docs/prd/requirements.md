**FR2**: System must generate and evaluate 500+ Python transformation functions per task using LLM-guided evolutionary search (proven 53.6% approach)

**FR3**: System must implement leave-one-out task generation for test-time adaptation with rotation/flip augmentations

**FR4**: System must combine TTT neural approach with program synthesis to achieve 61.9%+ ensemble accuracy

**FR5**: Meta-learning framework must use self-consistency validation across invertible transformations

**FR7**: System must generate interpretable reasoning traces showing both neural confidence and program logic

**FR8**: Ensemble must weight predictions based on task type classification (logic-heavy vs pattern-heavy)

**FR9**: System must implement grammar-guided genetic programming with LLM-seeded initial populations

**FR10**: DSL must include core ARC primitives: rotation, mirroring, color mapping, object manipulation (minimum 50 operations)

**FR11**: System must handle synthetic data generation creating 10x task variations for test-time training

**FR12**: Solution must implement efficient GPU memory management for 16GB constraint using gradient checkpointing

## Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1**: System must rotate between Kaggle (30hr/week), Colab (12hr sessions), and Paperspace (6hr unlimited) for 240+ GPU hours

**NFR2**: Development must use pre-existing implementations: MIT's TTT codebase and Jeremy Berman's evolutionary framework

**NFR4**: All experiments must be resumable across platform switches using cloud storage checkpoints

**NFR5**: Code must support both T4 and P100 GPUs available on free platforms

**NFR6**: System must implement efficient batching to maximize GPU utilization during free tier windows

**NFR7**: Architecture must support incremental improvements - start with 1B model, scale to 8B when stable

**NFR8**: Development must implement efficient resource monitoring and usage tracking

**NFR9**: System must cache all LLM-generated programs to avoid redundant API calls

**NFR10**: Solution must implement early stopping when confidence exceeds 95% to save compute

**NFR11**: Code must be modular enough to test components independently on CPU before GPU runs

**NFR12**: System must complete full pipeline test within first week to validate 2-month feasibility

**NFR13**: Development must follow the "2-Month Zero-Budget Execution Strategy" (see project memory: `zero_budget_execution_strategy`) for resource optimization and timeline management
