# Epic 7: Fallback Strategy (Contingency)

Goal: If we haven't reached 80% accuracy by Week 6, ensure we have a competitive submission focusing on stability and maximum performance from our best components.

## Innovation Tournament: Fallback Approaches

**Winner: Speed-Optimized Multi-Attempt Strategy**
- Ultra-fast inference (30 seconds/task)
- Generate 10+ diverse attempts per task
- Smart attempt generation using different seeds
- Historical data shows 5% accuracy boost from multiple attempts

## Story 7.1: Single Strategy Optimization

As a developer,
I want to maximize our best performing strategy,
so that we ensure a strong submission even without 85%.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: Identify best strategy (likely enhanced TTT)
2: Apply all optimizations to single strategy
3: Achieve maximum possible accuracy
4: Ensure rock-solid stability
5: Optimize for inference speed
6: Create multiple variants
7: Target 75%+ accuracy minimum

## Story 7.2: Ultra-Fast Inference Mode

As a developer,
I want 30-second inference per task,
so that we can try 10+ attempts within time limit.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: Reduce inference to <30 seconds per attempt
2: Implement aggressive caching
3: Pre-compute all possible optimizations
4: GPU kernel optimization
5: Parallel attempt generation
6: Smart early stopping
7: 10x more attempts within limit

**Critique & Refinement**: Consider implementing "attempt diversity maximization" where each attempt uses fundamentally different approaches, increasing the chance of finding the correct solution.

## Story 7.3: Ensemble Variant Creation

As a developer,
I want multiple submission variants,
so that we maximize our chances of success.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: Conservative variant (most stable)
2: Aggressive variant (highest accuracy)
3: Balanced variant (default)
4: Fast variant (maximum attempts)
5: All variants tested thoroughly
6: Clear selection criteria
7: Automated variant generation

## Story 7.4: Attempt Generation Strategy

As a developer,
I want intelligent attempt generation,
so that each attempt explores different solution spaces.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: Diverse initialization strategies
2: Orthogonal exploration paths
3: Historical success pattern usage
4: Task-specific attempt strategies
5: Attempt correlation minimization
6: 5%+ accuracy gain from diversity
7: Efficient attempt management
