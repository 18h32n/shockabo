# Epic 1: Foundation & TTT Baseline

Goal: Establish robust development infrastructure across all free platforms, implement Test-Time Training with 8B Llama-3 model, and achieve 53% baseline accuracy within 2 weeks. This epic provides the foundation for all subsequent development and validates our core approach.

## Parallel Work Streams (Reference: `epic_parallel_work_streams` in project memory)

**Stream A (Infrastructure) - Team Member A:**
- Days 1-3: Environment Setup + Evaluation Framework
- Days 4-6: Platform Automation (enables Epic 2 start)
- Days 7-10: Integration & Optimization

**Stream B (ML Implementation) - Team Member B:**
- Days 1-3: Data Pipeline + Environment Assist
- Days 4-6: TTT Baseline (1B model, 40% target)
- Days 7-10: Scale to 8B Model (53% target)

6: Implement early stopping for efficiency
7: Full pipeline test passes on 100 tasks

## Story 1.6: Platform Rotation Automation

As a developer,
I want automated platform rotation scripts,
so that I can maximize GPU utilization across free tiers.

1: Bash/Python scripts for platform switching
2: Automatic checkpoint upload/download to Google Cloud Storage (5GB free tier)
3: Queue management for experiment scheduling
4: Platform availability detection
5: Graceful handling of session timeouts
6: Email notifications for experiment completions
7: 95%+ GPU utilization achieved
8: GCS bucket creation and service account setup with secure key storage
9: Checkpoint versioning and cleanup strategy for 5GB limit

## Story 1.7: Authentication Framework Setup

As a developer,
I want the authentication framework configured,
so that API endpoints can be properly secured from the start.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: JWT token generation and validation implemented
2: FastAPI middleware for authentication configured  
3: Environment variables for JWT secrets set up
4: Basic user/service account model implemented
5: Authentication endpoints (/auth/login, /auth/refresh) created
6: Authentication documentation with example usage
